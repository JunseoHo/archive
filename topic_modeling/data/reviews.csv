introduction  h1 if being chased by a shark named bruce while hoarding all the trash in the ocean sounds fun  it is because it is at least once you go over the initial tedious hours  raft is a survival game in which  rather than fight zombies or demons  you have to deal with   a lot of water  aka the ocean  discover the story left behind as you explore uncharted seas  h1 control and map design  h1 raft plays out in a way that can be praised and criticized simultaneously  it gives freedom in approaching base creation and exploring the islands it features  resulting in a good experience in the long run  however  it has some design choices that can leave it feeling rather tedious and damage the game s pace for example  exploring an island is always thrilling  players must move around the land while keeping tabs on their raft  otherwise  they could lose it  animals on land can be dangerous but offer a good amount of food for the long term  making them an attractive high risk  high reward hunt  likewise  expanding the raft is rewarding  too  as the player can grow crops  upgrade their items and  most importantly  have a comfortable space to move around https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2987956821conversely  the fact that certain materials can only be obtained by specific tools or that they can get monotonous in the long run hampers some of the possibilities raft looks to offer  islands start to look and feel the same  while the progression of the raft can be determined by how many players are playing  one to two players can result in dull  slow growth in contrast to four to eight players  which makes the grinding of materials more bearable  h1  strong points  h1 the strong point of raft is that the game visuals are mesmerizing  while the gameplay can be engaging if done right  it is a game that is both challenging and fun  where most troubles have a temporal solution rather than a permanent one until you reach a certain point  the ocean looks beautiful and comes alive as waves threaten to swallow your raft or put you in reach of the shark to bite https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2987957250fighting the shark on itself offers some degree of ingenuity regarding gameplay  one player can distract it while other attacks or timing attacks correctly on certain sections can stop the shark mid attack  if confrontation is not your forte  you can use shark bait to get rid of the shark for a while  these options in dealing with problems allow a good amount of freedom for the player to consider their approach to situations  h1  art design and visuals   h1 the visuals of raft are excellent  with the ocean looking vibrant both from the outside and the inside  the islands offer ecosystems on land and sea  as numerous animals live in both areas  you can find giant birds throwing rocks at you or a group of fish to collect  it is not the most pretty game out there  but it indeed commits to making the aspect of being stranded in a raft appealing visually  h1 sound  replayability and performance  h1 there is no voice acting  nor does the narrative demand lengthy sessions  raft is all about making your own story of survival  and the sound effects are solid  rain  waves  and water movement all have a noise that immerses you more  and i found my experience at best during solid tides in the deepest part of the ocean  https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2987957514replayability wise  the game is as infinite as you want to play it  rather than being a game you replay after beating it  however  this title seems more in line with having a long run on a server  if the player desires  there is a narrative to follow  but there is enough room to make gigantic constructions on the water so that the raft looks more like a city  my specs are rtx 2060  36 gb of ram  intel core i7 11700k   core i7 11th gen rocket lake 8 core 3 6 ghz lga 1200  on high

risk high reward gameplay that begs to explore the depths     visually charming with how the seas are portrayed along the islands   list   td  td  list     progression can sometimes be dull and tedious  especially at the start     some design choices  such as limited freedom by specific tool usage  counter each other   list   td   tr   table  h1  conclusion  h1 raft is a beautiful survival game that  while at times can feel like an unfinished beta of sorts  adds something unique to the survival genre  fight the ocean as you look to survive being stranded  lack of food or water  or being eaten by sharks  i recommend the game if you enjoy survival games and have at least three other friends to play with 8 10  greatif you enjoy and find the review helpful  please follow my curator

i want this game  this game is something special   the fact that i am writing this review is huge  i almost never review any games this game is actually extremely good  the world was a bit  boring  in the first hour  when i was in the plain landscape and didn t have many skills  but it quickly evolved after that and hooked me around the 2 hour mark  the graphics are really beautiful  when you get past the  plain  normal world  intro area   the sound effects are fantastic  the skill trees and classes and depth are brilliant i can see why there s a huge cult around it  the creator is just a nerd like us  and he wants to make the ultimate arpg for himself  this game is not driven by the apathy and greed of typical  big business  game companies  just watch his development streams and various interviews  mike is one of us  and he s a great guy everything in this game s design respects you  the player  it s not a soul less  corporate money sucker like most other arpgs even the pre order bonus is pro customer  the only thing you get by pre ordering is a small guppy pet  which is available in every edition of the game  even base edition   all other deluxe ultimate items will remain available after launch too  and guess what  if you decide that you want any of the cosmetics of the more expensive editions  you can buy the upgrade to those cosmetics for the exact price difference  if this was any other company  they would have used  fomo   fear of missing out  to guilt you into the more expensive editions immediately in fact  this game will never sell any powerful items  only skins  and the game already gives you beautiful skins just by playing it and finding items  so you don t need to buy any skins at all the game will also never have any paid dlc expansions  all world expansions will be completely free what a refreshing game developer every game mechanic is also a labor of love  and are meticulously designed  there is so much innovation in this game that it s kind of blowing my mind how good it is inventory tetris  wasting 1 hour per day optimizing your storage layout  nope  there s a 1 click sort button a huge  messy inventory and world floor full of unidentified items  with a bunch of scrolls of identification and scrolls of town portal in your inventory at all times  nope  portals are free  good  why should we permanently waste 1 slot for that    items are already identified  good  why should we waste time and space carrying totally worthless items around    but best of all  the game has a built in loot filter builder  where you can easily tell it  hide all plain items  show me magic items  highlight items that give boosts to my class skills  etc  the system is very deep yet very easy to use  you can play with the exact loot filters you need a cluttered inventory filled with endless crafting items that are playing tetris  nope  there s a  send to crafting forge  button usable anywhere in the world  which moves them all into permanent storage immediately stash tabs  you get 100  huge tabs  with a global  name stats  search   entirely via in game gold crafting  one of the best systems i ve ever seen  you can break down items to extract their affixes  and then attach them to other powerful items  you can literally craft your own specialized gear being trapped in a build  nope  you can respec everything except your chosen mastery  ascendant class  basically   and the respec costs are very reasonable  usually just a bit of in game gold  or the time to level up your newly chosen skills  it s very liberating to be able to change your mind after investing countless hours into a character and then there s the way they have solved the  auction house goblin vs farmer  gameplay styles  you can specialize into trading or farming  depending on what you prefer to do  and you cannot trade items with the other  faction   so you can relax and enjoy the part of the gameplay you prefer the most they also solved the  auction house goblin  problem in these games  by making items account bound after you buy them from other players  so you won t see goblins buying up all items on auction and re selling them for 10x the price  because that s totally impossible in last epoch  thank god this just scratches the surface of the amount of innovation in this game the game even contains in game help in every tooltip  by holding alt  which reveals what every buff and status effect means  and also has an in game guide with the g key which means that i have never had to visit a wiki for this game  all of that is of course searchable in game  so you can quickly find your answers  it s such a refreshing game design i ve played 18 hours online in beta  and have zero bugs and zero lag  world transitions take around 3 6 seconds  at 25ms ping to eu west  people who said that the game lags online or that  everyone knows the eu servers are awful  must have terrible internet connections perhaps most importantly of all  i have never seen any complaints about the game in the game s global chat either  that means the people who actually play the game are enjoying it my favorite game of this style was diablo 2  the classic  this game has definitely dethroned that   d so it even managed to beat my massive nostalgia goggles   p maybe diablo s story is a bit cooler  gothic devil stuff   but last epoch s story is brilliant too last epoch also easily beats diablo 3 and 4  the soul less corporate games  those games are so bland  so dumbed down  and so monetized that i am amazed that anyone even plays them at all and it even beats path of exile  the  you need a math degree to make a viable build that won t get you crushed at endgame   the story of path of exile is literal nonsensical garbage  and the world design is nowhere near as cool either  i used to love path of exile  but last epoch is way  way more fun in every way in last epoch  every build is viable  yet there s tons of depth to every character  each base character can specialize into 3 different masteries  which unlocks different class trees and skills  furthermore  every skill in the entire game has their own per skill trees where you can choose your favorite customizations and adapt the skills to your desires  in very meaningful ways that wildly change the way the skill is used the per skill trees are very deep and rival the size of entire class trees of diablo  and they allow you to make any skill in the game viable for endgame  sure  there s technically a  best meta  like every other game in the world  but the difference here is that you can play the way you want to play  and you don t need to follow guides like a slave it is even close to the skill depth of path of exile  without needing a math degree to play it  you ll discover that there are some  obvious  paths to play simple builds in last epoch if you re a beginner  but there s simultaneously an incredible amount of depth for people who want to create wild  crazy  unique builds with chain cast synergies this is an amazing game  and i have complete faith in the game designers  it s the best arpg i ve ever played update about online post launch  i ve played online since day 1  with 3 60 second loading times",2024-02-20,2024-02-26,True,3781,82,0.908364951610565186,0,True,False,True

menu  some missing qol features  detailed below  h2 pros   h2  b combat    b  combat is fantastic  always have loved the 6 team parties  the front back row set up  hero combos  and rune system  playing on hard  and not grinding levels  has led to having some difficult boss fights that require using all the combat mechanics  boss fights also can have a gimmick involved  some are basic but others are really interesting and not something i expected with this type of combat  yes  random encounters will devolve into using auto combat  but outside of souls like games  i have never had  difficult  random encounters or trash mobs  some of the rare random encounters will act like mini bosses and auto will not be good enough unless you are overlevelled   b music    b  the music is top notch  they do a great job at using it with the main story  the only thing i want from the music  is even more of it  not really music but the only thing i would critique in the sound category is that they could have used some more ambient background noise in places  like tavern sounds  city bustle  nature noises  applause  or sounds of cheers   b characters    b  the characters are great  very distinct  anime like personalities  i think they especially nailed it with the 3  main  characters of nowa  seign  and marisa  i struggle with deciding who to use in my party cause i like so many of them  there are even characters that i thought i was going to not like off first impression and then came to really like them  whether that is from story moments or use in combat  as someone who loved suikoden series  i can already see some of these optional side characters continuing their stories in any hopeful sequel   b story    b  this part will be the most work in progress  as i have yet to beat the game  early thoughts is that the main story is very solid and interesting  i am looking forward to where it goes  love all the nods to the suikoden series  my main critique about the story would be its pacing  the events just happen back to back it feels  there is rarely a sense of skipped time between story beats and some events are stated to happen in incredibly fast amounts of time that don t line up  i felt like the suikoden games handled this better with little hints to other story things happening with allies alongside your character s   b visuals    b  the characters  enemies  and animations are fantastic  i have always thought the suikoden 2d visuals were some of the best  these are just more defined and beautifully animated for the modern era  the 3d dungeons and towns are good but clearly give a feel of older generation  probably a limitation of developing for switch too  have surprisingly caught myself though finding a blend of the superb 2d characters and the 3d world still giving me multiple eye catching moments  2 main critiques  1  the over world doesn t add anything visually being 3d  2  the background image in towns outdoor dungeons  b duels    b  duels return from suikoden and are just as fun  feel like they went the extra mile with improving this feature  the story moments and animations are great   b base    b  base building system is solid  fun progression  more interaction with building up the place compared to suikoden games that just evolved based on amount of characters recruited  at first might seem like you will have to worry about resource gathering a lot  but you can quickly build passive resource generation early on that will take care of the vast majority of your needs  only thing i would change is that i wish our base was one of the runebarrows  would have made it more aesthetically distinct   b minigames    b  minigames have been enjoyable  feel like i can t properly go over this till i know i have done them all  know for sure that is not the case yet   b voice over    b  most of the voice over work is great  japanese voice over will have some notable credits for anime fans  english voice over is also good for the most part  again  especially enjoy the vo for nowa  seign  and marisa  perrielle i feel deserves a shout out too  i enjoy the use of different accents to bring characters to life  with that said  there are also english ones that feel like they are not so good or the voice doesn t fit the character  on the rare occasion it also feels like there are some technical quality issues with the recording of the line   h2 mixed   h2  b war battles    b  war battles are alright  i preferred the more fire emblem lite system from suikoden 2  these ones play out more like a basic version of total war fights  without the rts  so far have not had a way to influence or customize units for the war fights  will update if that changes  b localization    b  has clear and  i glaring  i  issues in places but overall negativity blown out of proportion  from what i have seen though is that the main story itself is basically the same  outside of 1 character that seems heavily changed throughout  it is just certain random moments with some characters will seem super off and out of nowhere  a lot of the g pg insults come from the game itself going for a e rating  which just takes you out of the moment when these adults are using 5 10yr old language  i personally put more of the blame of that on the rating they aimed for  cause most people would not blink at the dialogue if it was using insults age appropriate to the character   h2 cons   h2  b background image    b  in towns and outdoor dungeons the background image uses 3d terrain models with very little texture or detail  the low detailed background only works when you do your best to hide or ignore it  but you will sometimes get these outdoor pan out shots  and the background becomes apparent to you  worst is probably if you go to the top of your castle for the scenic view  and it just green and grey shapes with no detail  ruins what could be a lovely shot   b party item management menu    b  the general menu you will be opening and using the most  for party and item management  is very clunky to use  takes a good while to get somewhat used to it  still always catch myself fumbling through it  will say that i feel that the menus for stores  mini games  and other home base stuff is done well though  b  other thoughts    b  there are some other qol things i find a little frustrating the game lacks  1  game  i needs  i  a help page that details what each stat does  power  magic  phys def  and magic def are obvious  but what exactly does skill  speed  and luck affect  nothing in game tells you at all  all i know for sure is that speed determines turn order  2  not being able to manually save on the world map  i will note that the game does auto save every time you enter the world map  but you only get 1 auto save and sometimes want to save before entering a location  3  game could really benefit from a side quest log for recruitment  sometimes you might forget what someone wanted and its annoying that you have to google and hope for no spoilers or go all the way to them just to be reminded  overall  i love the game  been waiting for this for so long  i am happy to have the spirit of the suikoden franchise return  a franchise that was so dear to my heart growing up  eiyuden is a world that has felt instantly familiar to me  i am greatly enjoying my time with it and can t wait to see how the story fully pans out  hope there will be a sequel  cheers rabbit   bear",2024-04-26,2024-04-26,True,28,0,0.67653733491897583,0,True,False,False

that taste  i ll break it down  but the tl dr is  medieval x com  story  no overarching story  but   wartales is in a weird place here  because there is a lot of worldbuilding going into this  but you won t be told any of it  very show  no tell  you re just dropped into this world  and there aren t any conversation trees but each region has its own self contained story  often involving choosing between a couple of factions  so far  i haven t had any where i didn t flip flop between them  which is fine  you re a mercenary company  you literally owe no one allegiance  and once you ve done the whole plot thing  you can go swing by the blacksmith to buy your reward  a book that unlocks  5 armor repair per unit of scrap  it s  efficient repair  as the big reward from each region s plot  granted  they all stack  and each tier of equipment has substantially more and more armor points to bolt on top of your squishy peeps to keep them not dead yet  so it s    it has value  it s just    very far from being an exciting and interesting reward  compared to a lot of other perks you can unlockprogression  a little from column a   the progression in this game is largely why i call this medieval x com  your characters have levels  and at some levels  they get to pick a perk ability  but also  your company acquires knowledge  which lets you acquire some benefits for all  and develop upgrades to recipes and camp equipment  often recipes grant first time construction bonuses that refund some knowledge xp  it s a rebate system  which helps balance the way recipes are relevant when you have the ingredients  and useless without them    which helps you learn that while lower tier recipes helps you save weight and make meal efficiency better  higher tiers have perks you ll also gain progression in 4  paths   groupings of playstyle related repeatable achievements that grant their own perks    and some hidden advantages that unlock at higher levels  like slotting 2 oils into a weapon  or more options for your battle standard  once acquired  and then there s the camp equipment  build a nice tent  raises the cap on valor points    and makes it easier to recover them when resting  better cook pot with a good cook on it  reduces the food demand day  so everybody s happy and resources last longer  this part honestly feels pretty great  when i can see that every upgrade is going to make things better  even if sometimes it s a weird sort of better  i got a healing station  which will cure an injury overnight without spending medicine    first upgrade increases capacity  so you can put 2 people in  the 2nd one  if they do not need treatment  they get the  drugged up  status effect  which lets them ignore 1 injury  this is surprisingly handy right now  because i need to grind another level onto my units before i can upgrade their armor again  and they re not all going to cross that threshold at the same time there s a couple bits i don t need  but everything really does work together pretty well  especially now that i ve got a bard clever mechanics  so your tank has depression   one weird element in this is the willpower morale system  as you whittle down enemies in a fight  balance shifts  as removing a foe removes its willpower contribution    at one threshold  your side gains a status effect that boosts damage by 50   at the next  the remaining enemies will  if you allow it  fek off  i love this  most people animals are not driven to fight to the last against a superior foe  they  should  want to run  to disengage  to gtfo  that s sensible  this is also why willpower has the lowest cap of any stat  if it could go higher  it would be    destabilizing  you d have an advantage  but you d also lose a lot if when you lose a unit at 15 points  willpower also grants units a last stand  they won t die at 0 hp  they ll just be dying  and first aid can get  em back on their feet  depression is a trait some units can have that lowers willpower by 2  so that they can t get there    unless you have a bard in the camp giving everyone  1 to willpower  or have  em be your camp scholar or bard  and maybe a wee belt trinket that buffs willpower slightly  but that bard effect    if you ve got 10 12 people on the field  you have kinda got an extra person worth of morale that you don t have to feed or pay for    that s not bad more  more and then you have the surprises that come up later  like cursed villages and catacomb exploration archaeology    and the largest goddamn city in the world  and boss fights  and quests that unlock new sub classes if you like x com s formula of missions  management  base improvement  crafting  and resources    and don t mind a lot of little stories to explore instead of an overarching one    this can be a real good time  but if you need direction  and want to work towards an ending    i don t think you re going to find that  there s a lot of dimensions to the gameplay  but they re not all that deep  you ll have a good time  but most of it will be very forgettable looking over some guides leftover from the ea period  i can see that a lot of elements were thrown at the wall to see what sticks  and honestly  it s kind of amazing how much they got to keep  and how much works  it s not entirely graceful  but it s hard to do i d really like to see a sequel or expansion  ideally with a bit of narrative questline carrying us through a story    and leaving some post game challenges to pursue   actually  that s kind of what this feels like  like the main quest is over and we re cruising the world to clean up sidequests  huh  either way  a good time  and i d kind of like a bit more of it  edit  just saw the roadmap so  it looks like their plan over the next 6 months is going to fix some of the rough edges  and sell more zones as dlc  quite literally  they re giving me what i was hoping for a reason to come

and work our way down the fishing minigames are phenomenal and the way that different fish have different shape as a component of inventory management makes for a truly exceptional mechanic the lore descriptions on the aberrant fish are absolutely top tier lovecraft horror  just so good  i can vividly imagine some of them  such as the defaced skate  great stuff the graphics  music  and overall atmosphere are very solid as a package  very clear art  sound  and style direction  excellent work the story is pretty okay  if you spend any time at all talking to obviously important npcs  you can probably predict the entire story before you re 1 4 of the way through it  just like i did  if you look at my achievements  you can see i have only the secret ending  this was not difficult to find and i went through the game entirely blind let me give you a huge spoiler about literally every story in every game ever  especially indie titles  spoiler if your main character starts the game with no memory and there are cryptic messages about someone going crazy a disaster the end of the world some other catastrophe of mystery  then it s you  you re the bad guy  you caused it   spoiler there is one npc that handles all of your sales  upgrades  research  and resupply  they even sell the rare components for upgrades and her inventory refreshes  she also sells the unlockable  crafted  items and she s never very far away  this one stop shop makes every non fishing mechanic feel cheap and simple  why bother travelling anywhere when i can just farm crabs directly in front of the one npc that can unlock everything the horror elements are actually kind of weak  the game breaks the  don t show the monster  rule very early  and consistently exposes you to the monsters directly  there were certainly some surprises in this part of the game  but nothing iconic or memorable  except for one event that happened to me only one time that i don t want to spoil   the worst part is that during the day  everything is fine  but during the night  the entire world becomes saturated with hazards  so you re constantly exposed to what should be a mostly imaginary threat  it shouldn t be so obvious also  you re rarely required to go out at night  so you can totally ignore this part of the game most of the time  the game is at its best when you re trying to get home for the night  slowly navigating a treacherous waterway in the dark while being hounded by some imaginary threat  sadly  this is extremely rare and is often overshadowed by silly monster antics and actual threats  if the map was better  this could have been a common occurrence  but this brings me to my final point the map is dull  it s extremely uniform and evenly distributed  the fishing locations are hyper delineated  the islands are super close together  every island is marked and every island has a point of interest  so there are zero reasons to explore anywhere that you cannot directly see  and in that regard  you can see everywhere from anywhere unless there is something in the way i know the devs are planning a lot of updates that i will be eagerly watching  so here is my wishlist  list        i wish there was a tackle box that could be used to attract different fish using different bait and lures instead of just  bait         i wish there was a reason to go out on open water beyond trying to catch the last 4 fish i needed        i wish the oceans had more than 2 types of weather  calm and bumpy   cresting huge swells in the dark because a storm rolled in would be so cool        i wish there were more secret locations        i wish i could buy different ships with different hulls that were better at fishing different waterways  instead of weirdly upgrading one ship to go everywhere  for example  my ocean trawler should bottom out in a shallow swamp         i wish there was a continuous reason to visit different towns  the treasure npc is the perfect example  more of this please         i wish there was a late game money sink  i finished the game with  50k saved up just by completing my pokedex         i wish there was an animation for your boat sinking after taking damage  instead of an immediate and jarring respawn screen   list and more than anything  i really wish the islands were a lot further apart and you were forced to face your fears and sail the open seas in the dark  take away 90  of the  spooky  things in the dark because they re far too common and are mostly a nuisance  and then scale the map to be 400  further between destinations let me be clear  i loved the game  it was a great experience overall  but it did leave me longing for a lot more  the greatest strength of the game is the core fishing mechanic and the subtle horror of the mutated fish  and yet weirdly  that somehow takes a back seat to gimmicky threats in the dark and bizarre  boss  fish that i suppose are meant to scare you but mostly just act as a nuisance that prevent you from fishing anyway  if you like fishing games and driving a cute little boat  play the game  it s a really good game  it deserves the rating that is has been

water for a living  sometimes it s useful parts that you can use to upgrade your boat  sometimes it s valuable relics that can be traded for cash  sometimes it s fragments of a terrible secret  fish on and discover the truth the gameplay cycle is simple  easy and casual  traverse the seas and explore  fish for creatures and stuff  upgrade your fishing tools and boat  sell for a profit  and repeat  interspersed come little missions that can be solved with a combination of the above  dredge the seas for trinkets and deliver them to someone  upgrade to catch better things  more efficiently  minigames for each activity keep things simple but engaging  docks serve as saving points  and they are conveniently distributed around the map  you are never too far from any of them  so this game can be played in short bouts of a few minutes  if that is your wish  you cannot hop out of the boat  and your actions are permanently ocean locked  interactions with npcs are also severely limited i have seen it compared to  i sunless sea  i   but this game is not as mythologically deep  and is much more approachable  while the former is terrifically specific even to the point of information overload  i dredge  i  is abstract and simple  this does not make either game any less poetic  they re each good in their own way  one with long novelesque winding prose  the other with short snippets of flavor text people call it lovecraftian  but actual  direct relation is minimal  they refer to the tone and the setting of the story  rather than connections to the lore and work of h p  a psychologically tormented protagonist in a small rural setting around the 1930 s  isolated from the rest of the world  where strange events start happening that seem to lead to a supernatural disaster  possibly involving undisclosed extraplanar entities  such is the layout for every lovecraft story  and also for this game  there s no blood and no gore and the few monsters you ll encounter are not really terrifying  we could classify the experience as a very mild psychological dread tale a notch below actual horror the story is there  handed to you by means of messages and npc dialogue  but you must piece it together yourself  in terms of lore  it gives you very little information and leaves the rest for you to imagine and complete the picture  like lovecraft himself  this is where both game and writer triumph  unlike many other games lately  which force feed you with mostly useless and abstruse lore  this game succeeds at being mysterious but also getting to the point quickly mechanics wise  the game has a clever way to highlight important concepts and ideas with colored text  but you must still pay attention  it is not  however  a hard game by any means  either cognitively or in terms of psychomotor abilities  no hand holding  but very easy and logical puzzles  this is an extremely good point in an age of obscure puzzling  content bloat and game padding a big chunk of the gameplay experience seems to depend on luck it s a fishing game  after all and there s lots of species and varieties to collect  but still  it feels fair  i never sensed it forced me to waste my time  even after setting up a voyage to deliberately fish a specific species  after a few minutes  usually less than five  i was able to catch it  of course  you need to know what you re doing  but the game helps you a lot with that  the encyclopedia is very useful for this  be sure to use your acquired skills constantly  they are real time savers  and also help you get out of tight situations safely physics are solid  and the controls do not feel floaty or unresponsive at all  i played with an xbox one wireless controller without issues  movement while in spyglass mode  however  is terrible  it should have been adjusted for a finer control the graphics are weird at first  but you ll get used to them  not ugly  by any means   i dredge  i  captures correctly the sense of dread at night  of fear  and also the loneliness of the high seas  the water is beautifully rendered  and the sense of depth you get from the unfathomable ocean is fantastic  you can almost feel the cold of the sea breeze  the aberrant creatures are interesting and creative  and their otherworldly pictures perfectly convey their strangeness  complemented by delightful descriptions  sounds are great and the ambience is excellent  but the music can get tiring  especially in its repetitiveness while resupplying at the traveler s pontoon  i dredge  i  has two possible endings  but if you play it right especially the exploring part you ll immediately detect the correct path  i found them a bit anticlimactic and simplistic both of them  perhaps a bit more production in the effects and music department could have done the trick  still  it provides a closure even if poorly explained and quickly executed despite the  mystery   objectives are clear  most of the time  the big red  i x  i s on the map provide adequate guidance  and you can customize it with markers  too  for the rest of the riddles and puzzles  pay attention to the colored texts and you re good to go  it s all very logical  go in blind and avoid walkthroughs or guides  you can do this on your own it is a relatively short game that can be possibly finished in less than 8 10 hours  at a relaxed pace  i explored and admired

 every character has multiple styles of play  you can focus on one of their 2 special abilities or on abilities that improve your weapons  but this is not required  you can use a bit of all 3 styles and still feel strong  most characters gravitate to certain kinds of weapons with which they will probably do best  all characters have 3 trees of 6 power ups that you can pick from after you finish a stage   a lot of different weapons to get there are over 50 weapons divided into 8 classes  most weapons feel unique and have their own gimmick  you can carry up to 2 weapons making certain combo s is possible  a downside with such a big selection is of course that some weapons feel like weaker versions of others  also each weapon being pretty unique means that some will not be suited to your style at all    permanent upgrades there is permanent progression between runs you can upgrade with a currency you get by playing  i know this goes against the definition of roguelike but all modern rogues have this feature  the devs can make harder more fun encounters that feel unfair but get less unfair the more you invest in this system which ultimately makes the game better since they can push the boundaries the game  you can also go for an extra challenge by not  partially investing in this to make it harder for yourself   difficulty settings there are 4 difficulties to play in  you are locked to normal at the start but unlock higher difficulties by beating the hardest difficulty you currently have  the 4th difficulty is the most unique  it features unique upgrades you can buy with the same currency used for the permanent upgrades  this means that currency is not useless when you unlocked the whole prema upgrades tree which is nice  which will change the way you play in a major way and is so much fun  the game never feels to unfair  you can win the game with any combination of weapons power ups as long as you can keep dodging   many upgradesduring the run you encounter these power ups called occult scrolls  they can straight up boost your damage survivability or change the way you play  some boost you in a big way but will also restrict you in a way  there is a lot of different  builds  you can aim to go for   4 worlds to go through  with their own enemies to fight the enemies are cool  there is ranged and melee enemies  some have unique mechanics that are not super hard to play around  of course this gets harder when it s accompanied by other enemies  enemies get harder in the later worlds  it s not uncommon to almost get oneshot there  the bosses of these areas are also very good  huge monsters in their own arena with alot of different attacks that have to be dealt with  and somewhere in between you are supposed to actually kill them   active devsthe game still gets regular patches and updates  there is still a roadmap for their future content like in the beta  they have added new characters  bosses  a new world and a new game mode since beta  there is still more to come as well  when you encounter bugs in game there is a feedback option which you can access during your run and explain the bug  and you actually get listened to  every bug i have reported over the years has been fixed in a reasonable time frame  almost always in the next patch   good pricingthis game is 100  worth getting at full price  it is more then reasonable if you see the huge amount of content here that puts aaa games to shame  there has been 1 dlc so far which included 2 characters  so far it is the only content that is gated behind a dlc  their new game mode that could have been a dlc in itself was added completely free  if you are looking for a game like this i would just buy it now   multiplayerthe game supports multiplayer  there is a matchmaker to play with random people as well  i cannot comment on the quality of that since i never did that  i have only played multi with 1 friend and it was fun  every player gets their own weapon and scroll drops so nobody can  steal  your upgrades like in risk of rain 2  if you don t need your drops you can press a button to make them visible for your allies so they can pick it up  you can help each other get to their preffered build faster but you can t get  griefed  by people that steal your drops  i feel this is the best way to create a multiplayer experience in a co op game  the new game mode can also be played with friends  tldr if you like this genre  you should definitely buy this  big worlds  al lot of characters  weapons and power ups  different difficulties for everyone  a multiplayer that is done extremely well for a co op game  the devs should feel very proud of what they accomplished with this game  i look forward to the bright future of this game the game has this big  one more run  feel that every good roguelike should have if i have to put a number on it it s a 9 5 10 for me  i hope this review helped any people with doubts to make a good

despite being part of the problem themselves  there will be a tldr  otherwise here we go this game is a good game  is it a great game  no  is it a bad game  no  it is a solid good title if you are looking for a game that is not a twitch  run and gun shooter  but also don t really have the patience to learn to play something like arma iii  this game is all about team play and communication  if you can t do either of these things this game is not for you  having a mic is pretty much required if you want to play in anything other than a regular infantry squad  and even then you are putting your team at a severe disadvantage by not having one  the game is strongly in favor of being historically accurate  with some minor tweaks for gameplay reasons   so much so that the maps you play on are straight up recreations of the real life locations from back during the years of world war ii  the various fronts  uniforms  and sounds this game uses to create its atmosphere is awesome  when you re in the shit with your face in the dirt you honestly get scared from how intense it all can be  players will even do some light hearted roleplay over proximity when they re calling for a medic which can get pretty funny this game is slow and the gameplay reflects this  the fact that the two game modes  warfare and offensive  can last for a whole 1 hour 30 minutes or 2 hours respectively frequently speaks to this  you will be running for minutes on end a lot  you will be dying a lot  respawn waves often take 20  seconds depending on where you spawn  capturing points takes 2 minutes and the enemy can stop you very easily  there will be many times where you will be shot  burned  blown up  or knifed and you will never see your attacker  there will be times where you will never know where the enemy is coming from  there will be times where you will go half an hour without a single kill  or maybe even a whole game  there will be times when you push the enemy back to their last point only for everything to fall apart on that final push and suddenly you are the one on your last point then there will be times where you kill 20 people all by yourself  there will be times you singlehandedly turn the tide of a match with one spawn point  one kill  one explosion  there will be times where you work with your squad to accomplish an objective that allows another squad to accomplish theirs which allows the commander to do his thing to clinch you the game  there will be times where you fight for every bloody inch of a point for 30 minutes and then finally come out on top  there will be times where you fight over the midpoint the whole game and it comes down to the literal second on the timer  and then everyone cheers when you successfully cap  there will be times when you lose  but you won t care because the enemy played so well and your team matched them blow for blow that it felt like you didn t lose anything at all  there will be times when you fight an epic last stand and you just manage to beat the clock that it makes you feel like you really are fighting a war hell let loose is not without its issues  medics are alright  but they could be better  the artillery system needs changes in how it affects gameplay  although personally that issue is way down on the list   the british faction is kind of a mess  there are some bugs still stubbornly around  the flamethrower is underpowered  and collision  especially driving  on certain objects is really annoying  but you often forget about a lot of this when your charging towards the point and people are blowing up around you and machine guns are laying down suppressive fire and you finally reach the trenches and sweep through them killing everyone in your path  those cinematic moments straight out of band of brothers or saving private ryan is what you play for sometimes you will hate this game and wonder why you wasted your time on such a hopeless match with such idiotic teammates  other times you will love it and wish you could play with the guys you met in that game forever  the lows can be really low  but the highs can be really high there are those that say this game is going down the drain and this is not a true  some of this game s veteran community has become extremely jaded over the past year and a half or so for a variety of reasons  some of them are warranted and some of them aren t  when i first got this game back in december of 2021 the community was awesome  never met such nice and patient people so consistently in a game about brutally murdering each other during the worst war of human history  this community is no longer that most of the time  it is full of veterans who are no longer understanding of new players  it is full of servers run by admins who think they are always right  who can t be challenged at all lest their fragile egos crack  bickering is frequent  arguments and name calling are plenty  roaming bands of clan tags will constantly complain and heckle in chat  and most people don t want to lead teams because they don t want command screaming in their ear constantly the whole game not all veterans are like this  but most of the whining does not come from the new players because these vets constantly scare them off with their horrid attitudes and elitism  it s like watching a cod lobby unfold over the course of an hour and a half  there are those who still try to make the game as enjoyable as possible  shout out to mcbluffin and his crew  go check them out and join their discord awesome people   but they are unfortunately the minority of interactions i see nowadays  i will never forget teaching a new player how to tank and him telling me at the end of the match  hey  thanks for teaching me  i was gonna drop this game because of the previous crew i was working with  but you guys made me change my mind  to all the new players or prospective buyers there are kind veterans out there  so stick it out  it is worth it  trust me  once you find the right group this game is like magic  and drugs   you will never want to stop playing  this game is worth your money  the team17 take over has been bumpy regarding the release of u14 and the  trailer   but this game is far from dead  most of the bugs seen nowadays are legacy bugs from when black matter was still developing  something the vets will neglect to tell you due to their hate boners  and team17 is currently ironing them out  they ve already tackled fixed quite a few and i am hopeful that they will figure the rest out soon  this game is in no worse a state than it was a year and a half ago  and is no worse off than when black matter was developing  so please  give this game a try  it will surprise you  i know it surprised me tldr  this game is solid  it s got problems concerning various longstanding bugs and certain systems need attention  but they are being worked on  its got great atmosphere and some real cinematic moments  its had some bumpy trials since team17 took over  but they have smoothed them out for the most part  some of the veteran community could use a real attitude adjustment  but not everyone is crotchety  its not great  its not terrible  but it is good and worth your time  give this game a try  hop on with some buddies or find some of your own in game and go win the war  7

hint of overwatch   b as an fps veteran of almost two decades  i actually don t have much to say about the minute to minute gameplay of roboquest other than the fact it s immaculately designed  this is one of those games where if you re familiar with the genre  everything just instinctively  i works   i  as soon as i was given control in the demo i could immediately tell just the basic movement alone was incredibly well crafted  it s kind of absurd how good of a job they did  i was hooked in less than an hour the gunplay is immensely satisfying  the combat demands your full attention at all times  the classes skills and items come together to make varied and fun build combinations every run  the soundtrack by noisecream is  b ridiculous  b   i  there isn t a single track in the entire ost i didn t like   i  and the art direction takes your eyes on a romantic dinner date under the pale moonlight at the most luxurious dining establishment money can afford in lyon  france  hometown of developers ryseup studios basically everything is on point  ryseup almost doesn t skip a beat  the beats they  b do  b  skip don t even warrant anything but minor complaints  which i ll list from most to least important   b there will be spoilers past this point   b  h1 content  h1 what s likely the most recurring complaint with players  while the game isn t  i barren  i  by any means  it really does stretch that  25 price tag to it s limit  there s roughly 30 hours of game to play give or take about 10 depending on how fast you do it all  and while that s obviously not a  i short  i  amount of time  for a roguelite game like this that s definitely on the shorter side of things in terms of replay value and after you ve done everything  there s currently no point  b to  b  replaying the game other than to beat your best times  beating it on higher difficulties  or just because you feel like it  i will say though  you know you got a masterpiece on your hands when the biggest complaint from players is that  b they want more game to play   b  h1 balance  h1 the game is overall balanced very well  but there s some slight issues here and there low damage high fire rate weapons like smgs  ars  and lmgs could use a buff  i never use them over anything else  most other weapons outclass them in every way in my experience  some more niche weapons like the mine launcher and dragoon mortar i never use either  the damage they deal isn t worth using over something more conventional  i can t think of much else when it comes to weapons though  they re all good in their own ways the game likes to sometimes throw just a few more enemies than you can handle at one time  leading to a perfectly good run coming to a sudden halt when you can t chew through everything the game expects you to handle  the worst example of this being   the final two battle rooms on the moon are harder than the fight with iris herself  this has been the case with every run i ve had that s gotten there  even with power crystals  way too many things being thrown at you at once  even with a strong build it s always the hardest part of the moon  h1 character   story interaction  h1 after de corrupting iris and watching the end cutscene  nothing really  i happens  i  in game  you re still in the same old basecamp as you were at the start  nothing s been changed or added  it feels odd doing the same gameplay loop over and over when i ve already fixed iris and haven 8 is back up and running  y know  my headcanon is that the guardians are just really bored afterwards and they keep bugging iris to make more badbots for them to fight  much to her annoyance  having the option to move the camp to haven 8 after the end would be a cool addition  but i realize this might be more dev work than it s worth it s also odd that max is the only character who properly speaks to you in game amongst the smattering of other npcs that exist  i feel like there were a lot of missed opportunities for some fun interactions there  having these npcs hang out in your camp after completing their side quests would ve been a cool feature as well  as the camp in it s current state is pretty lifeless despite the very lived in feel  h1                                           h1 all in all  an absolutely stellar game made by a relatively unknown studio up until this point  or at least i myself have never heard of them  if you like fps games in any capacity  roboquest is worth every single penny even with the slightly lacking amount of content it contains at launch  i m sure ryseup will stuff it with more content over time with the amount of attention and positive reception the game s getting  so if you feel like the current price tag is a bit much for what you get  just wait until then or wait

there  and you can continue playing it for as long as you d like  i d say there s practically infinite replayability in the real game  and in such a way that it s still fun  the community is extremely friendly and supportive  the modding community is very active  the developers are incredibly transparent and dedicated  and  the game is seriously fun to the point of being addictive how the game works this is a game about automation and scalability  it s one thing to automate something  it s another entirely different thing to scale it up  you start with a pickaxe and some starter resources  and mine copper  iron  coal  and stone by hand  and craft things like furnaces  conveyor belts  inserters  weapons  ammunition  science packs  and assemblers and other things  the goal is to launch a rocket  but that s very far away in terms of research and resources  research involves putting science packs into labs and selecting a current research in the tech tree to be worked on  there are 7 types of science packs  they have proper names  but most people refer to them by these colors in sequential order  red  green  gray  blue  purple  yellow  and white   where technologies higher in the tech tree begin requiring multiple types of science packs  so  you start putting your red science packs in the labs you ve made  and all is well until  you realize that this is going really slowly  it s all about scalability  and handmining and crafting isn t gonna cut it  so  you automate it all  you place down some mining drills  you make an assembly line with conveyor belts  inserters  assemblers  labs  and use steam engines with coal to power it all up  and all is well until  you realize that this is going pretty slowly  it s all about scalability  and a couple mining drills and a few assemblers isn t gonna cut it  so  you scale up your current production  you quadruple the number of drills  assemblers  and labs  you foresee that you ll need more power  so you build that out too  and all is well until  you realize that this is going kinda slowly  it s all about scalability  and some of the cogs in your well oiled machine got destroyed in an attack by the native biters and spitters  who are mad at the pollution your little factory is creating  you put up some walls  craft some turrets and ammunition  protect your base  track down the closest nests  exterminate them  and all is well until  you realize you ve finished all of the basic research and need to make green science packs in addition to red science packs now  you know it s all about scalability  so you get to work building up green science production  while at it  you tackle gray science too  so that you can benefit from researching those techs as well  you grow your factory  and all is well all is not well  you ran out of the coal in the starter ore patch  your starter iron ore patch is getting low and not producing as much  the biters and spitters are increasing in volume in response to the growth of your factory  and research progress is slowing down as the techs require more and more packs than ever before  drastic problems require drastic measures  and you know it s all about scalability  you unlock trains and build mining outposts at much larger ore patches  you fully automate ammunition production along with the deliverance of the ammo to the turrets  speaking of turrets  you double the number of them  you make the walls thicker  you quintuple your smelting and assembly lines  and you make yourself a car so that you can drive around and admire your growing factory further progress requires obtaining and processing new materials derived from crude oil  like plastic and sulfur  entirely new infrastructure is needed  and on a much larger scale than what exists for red  green  and gray science  blue science packs are much more complicated to produce  but the challenge of automating and scaling up production isn t a new concept at this point in the game  once you surpass the complexity  you will be ready for the rest of the game beyond this point is the switching to oil based power and or solar power  the eventual inevitable switch to nuclear based power  augmentation of machines with modules and beacons  an arms race against the biters and spitters  automation and scaling of purple and yellow science packs  growth of the factory on an unprecedented scale  streamlining of logistics and construction projects with the use of flying robot drones  and finally  at long last  the launching of the rocket is that the end of the game  you achieved the win condition  sure  but  rockets bring back white science packs  the last ones used for research  these are used for the infinite researches  where increasing levels continuously upgrade factors like mining productivity  weapon damage  and other things  you ve learned to automate and scale production to monumental scales  but you ve also learned that the factory must grow  so  you transition and pivot with a new goal in mind  scale up the factory so that you can launch rockets repeatedly  and move into the megabase stage of the game  where biters are exterminated with nukes and artillery rounds before they are even aware of the massive pollution cloud of your factory  and your factory can be quantified by how many science packs of all types you can produce per minute  or spm  bases that struggle to launch their first rocket are pretty low  maybe around 50ish  to qualify as a megabase  you need to hit over 1000 spm  some people go further  and hit 2k  5k  10k  or even 20k  it can be truly crazy and amazing to look back at what you ve done over the course of tens to hundreds of hours worth of playing sessions  what started as a simple assembly line for red science can turn into a massive  semi self sustaining factory in a way that feels completely natural and organic so  that s the base game  where do you go after you re done with your first map  you can start a new map and heavily alter things like how big the ore patches are  how far apart they are  how many biters there are  how fast they evolve  how expensive the crafting recipes are  and what the general layout of the maps look like  you can have a desert map  with scarce trees  massive ore patches incredibly far apart to promote the use of trains  with lots of biters in between that don t get too difficult over time  railworld run   or  have an island map with lots of trees  natural chokepoints  small but frequent ore patches  and relatively few biters that quickly get difficult to deal with head on  island hopping run   you can have challenge runs  with tons of quickly evolving biters  deathworld run   or the restriction where you can only handcraft 111 items  lazy bastard run   or where the map is still normal in width  but very short in height  ribbon world run   play multiplayer with friends too in any of these alternate playstyles the game definitely scratches an itch for problem solving in a way that no other game  i ve tried satisfactory and dsp and keep coming back to this game over those  has done for me  the game is so well optimized that you can have a massive megabase and still be running at a solid 60 fps without needing the latest hardware past this are mods and waiting for the new dlc to drop  this game has an incredible amount of content in the base game already  and mods and the dlc will extend the game by an honestly insane amount  from simple qol mods to having much greater depth and recipe complexity to exploring space and other planets  mods  and the dlc   can and will extend the game  i ll probably have thousands of hours in this game before i m done with it  if ever  the devs are my favorite devs for any game  they clearly love to play the game too and it shows  they call it cracktorio for a reason  and that reason is that the factory must grow",2024-01-19,2024-01-20,True,218,10,0.949338555335998535,0,True,False,False

improving for the future of this game what improved graphics the game is visually pleasing  featuring detailed wood types  walls  and furniture  it runs smoothly even on high settings  with beautiful neighbourhoods and interesting architecture building building in hf2 is a significant improvement from hf1  it s smoother  quicker to create  and easy to undo mistakes  the addition of laying bricks and different roof types enhances the experience  allowing for realistic recreations and quick adjustments  even if you re not a fan of building  it s worth trying for its user friendly approach sandbox mode a fantastic addition to hf2  fulfilling a need from hf1  the ability to build and playtest different builds is excellent  creating custom jobs  sharing them on mod io  and enjoying the community s astonishing creations make the game better  it s a great way for the community to come together moving doors windows controversial or not  the ability to easily adjust misplaced windows or doors in hf2 is a welcomed change  unlike hf1  where mistakes meant buying again  this convenience makes the process less tedious  especially in larger builds placing stuff grid snapping and precise placing i love it  aligning halogen lights flawlessly in hf2 is a breath of fresh air  it s a vast improvement from the frustrating experience in hf1 placing wallpapers tiles much better in hf2   fewer resources needed  more coverage  it s simple  smooth  and easy  only frustration comes when reaching high spots without buying scaffolding due to laziness  fykyk store navigating specific items in hf2 is a breeze  unlike hf1  you don t need specific names of the furniture piece you re after  for example  nightstands and coffee tables are in the same category with sub categories for easy access customisation choosing colours or patterns for sofas  chairs  or wallpapers in hf2 is fantastic  you can go all out with a zebra print house   literally nobody can stop you improved cleaning cleaning in hf2 takes longer  covering less area  and requiring precise targeting  yet  it s satisfying  especially spraying and wiping  the flipper instinct revealing all dirt ensures no stains can hide other  hf2 s wall painting tool lets you paint specific patterns without constant fixes  you can paint pixel art on the walls if you want to  the flipper tool allows easy style changes  copying  and duplication  you don t need to re buy items  just copy and paste style on whatever it is you need  wiring is a standout feature  allowing precise light control  each light to a different switch  you can get super creative with it  the overall beautiful lighting and lush gardens enhance the game s aesthetics and feel now  onto future improvements and additions needed for the game before after photos after my first house flip in hf2  the absence of a before after feature was disappointing  while it was a dlc in hf1  for hf2  this beloved feature should be part of the base game  it s immensely satisfying to see the changes  and i hope the devs add this in a future update blinds curtains or lack of them  surprisingly  the base game lacks a vital aspect of building renovating  having a few basic blinds curtains with customisation options would be acceptable  but the overall absence is disappointing doors the game lacks door variety  offering only a few choices  while customisation is possible  a broader selection beyond the most popular door types would be appreciated exploration i recall a dev stream mentioning the freedom to walk around the neighbourhood  allowing us more freedom  however  in the actual game  there s a border restricting exploration  which was disappointing  this was the first thing i checked in the game  using flight mode in sandbox is the only way to get close to neighbour houses  walking up to the porch isn t possible items in the early stages  limited assets are forgivable  but after completing the game in not a very long time  the lack of variety in assets became apparent  even with style changes  builds started looking the same  the current content doesn t justify the original price of the game selling houses compared to hf1  hf2 feels like a downgrade in that aspect  in hf1  satisfying specific buyer needs for achievements added depth  with remarks influencing the sale  hf2 lacks this  and i expected more in depth buyers and unique characters for selling houses paintings the lack of pictures in hf2 is a shocker  buying a picture frame seems pointless when houses have blank frames with no images available  even a few stock images would be an improvement  currently  it s a significant downgrade conclusion i d recommend house flipper 2 for its enjoyable story  graphics  and potential for growth  however  i believe essential additions should come through free updates  not just dlcs  now  i never expect things for free as i know the dev team worked really hard on this game and they deserve a pay for their work  however the current price should warrant more assets and expected features from hf1  i m excited for future dlcs  hoping for the return of pets  farming  luxury stuff  and a more immersive story  the game is fun and beautiful  but more assets and a deeper storyline are needed  in short  it offers a lot but also lacks in certain aspects  kudos to the devs for their hard work on this game  we hope to see more improvement in the upcoming updates",2024-01-03,2024-01-03,True,248,2,0.933151304721832275,6,False,False,False

3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10they are billions is a hardcore rts set in a post apocalyptic world where you are tasked to expand the empire by setting up new villages fighting off swarms of zombies and other monstrosities all they way until you ll be building up cities in some of the dodgiest and scariest places ever where survival is mostly just a vague hope graphically the game looks good but it s also very artistic the steampunk style is really well done and just helps set the atmosphere just right there s a genuine reaction that you feel with every new map that you play on with some very plagued maps all the way to rainy coasts or frosty mountains it all looks great and feels good to look at soundwise it s pretty standard the environment has a sad vibe and filled with threat tho as it should be the whole city itself has a soul to say so some people are walking doing their jobs others get scared by zombies that get to close to the walls or if they walk too close to them in general it s well made and just clicks with the game the story is also decent it s mostly centered around the survival of humanity and expansion of the empire you being one of the crazy yet brave generals that has this crazy and hard task of securing the future and make sure that humanity doesn t end in one big city now as gameplay goes that s where this game stands out by quite a lot  the main missions are relatively simple mostly just you having to build up a settlement kill some zombies or a boss get a certain amount of resources so technically it s nothing complicated  but that s where you re wrong the game itself is very difficult because you will in many cases underestimate just how many zombies there will be how easily they can get into your base and once they re in if you don t contain it fast you will certainly lose cause 3 zombies taking one house down leads to 8 zombies and then two more houses will be almost 20 zombies  to make matters worse for the player you got no checkpoints you lose at the last minute you have to try all over again  that is a bit bad since you lose all the progress on that map but it does help getting more used to the way the game works there is a nice research tree that you will unlock as you progress the game but do keep in mind you won t be able to get everything so do think about your choices cause you might end up making your game way harder than it s supposed to be  what i ve found working well for me was having as much economy and less consumers so that i could focus more on properly expanding and defending rather that about all the needs and lacks most missions will force you with some certain conditions be it less food on some parts or more energy consumption but even so while you expand and get the hang of the layout make sure that you build towers and walls set some soldiers in them   not archers those are mostly for quick scouting   and this way you ll prevent in most cases losing your entire mission  i ve learned the hard way what happens if you leave even a tiny corner unprotected    and it s not nice there s also a few missions where you control a hero those are quite good for getting the resources for the research trees also to beat certain swarm missions on the campaign which is also spread out across different routes to keep a bit of variety but all of them slowly getting harder and more demanding now bug related there aren t many one that kept sometimes happening was troops kinda getting stuck in each other when left alone patrolling dunno why maybe it was just a weird route i ve set up or could be something different but that was all overall for any rts fans especially those looking for a challenge  they are billions is definitely a must get providing a huge difficulty from the very beginning that only get s tougher as you progress but also the excitement and joy you get once you ve finally beaten a hard level is well worth it but if you re more of a casual player then maybe you

but instead of focusing on farming and animal raising  it focuses primarily on item crafting and micromanaging your machines there  are  farming aspects like plant animal growing  but those are hardly how you ll make money in mtas and very basic compared to any other dedicated farm simulator like story of seasons the presentation here is very good  for a game set in a desertic region the game graphics manage to be bright and colorful enough to prevent your eyes from getting bored from all shades of brown you knew and probably the ones you didn t https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2970291169 h1   a builder  not  just  a farmer  h1 what makes this game differ from the majority of farming sims out there is that  i your main source of income will be through commissions you can accept as sidequests  i  and every commission requires you to deliver a crafted item to someone initially you re limited to accepting only one per day  but as your workshop grows so will your ability to accept more commissions  protip  one social skill also helps   and by progressing in the game the commissions will become more complex and demanding  but also more rewarding in terms of money and workshop fame don t bite more than you can chew  though  every commission has a time limit and missing it means losing workshop prestige and opportunity to earn you money if you re hard pressed for money another option is to sell what you ve crafted to the right shops of the town  while commissions pay a lot more  this is one way to make some quick cash and since mtas is a game where the main focus is crafting  it shouldn t be surprising that there is a lot of item gathering  it might not be an exaggeration to say that you ll love or hate this game based on how much you like hoarding items and in order to run a successful workshop you will have to spend a portion of every day mining ore  chopping wood  scavenging or beating monsters for their item drops you cannot do everything every day due to the limited time  since your character will be forced to sleep at 3am  and  more importantly  due to your character s limited stamina while time passes on at a reasonable pace   i which can be slowed down or hastened at any point in the game through the options menu  i   recovering your stamina on the fly is not easy https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2968046333 h1   social activity   h1 building items is not the only thing you ll do in mtas  you ll also build relationships with the colorful citizens of the titular town of sandrock talking to people  gifting them what they like  helping them with commissions or their own sidequests are the usual ways to raise their disposition towards you  spar is another returning option which lets you challenge most characters to a friendly match once you become  buddies  you can also invite them to dates  platonic or romantic depending on the character  which allows you to know more about them romance and marriage have no gender restrictions and were made available in the last major update   knives out  as of this writing   but marriage isn t an option for every romanceable character yet   i be warned that the amount character events available vary from  high  to  very low   i   h1   unbuilder of monsters   h1 fighting monsters is nothing new here  the previous game had a fair amount of combat to be done  but it was rather shallow having very little variety and even less depth mtas tries to remedy it by introducing more weapon types  spears and daggers  each weapon has different speed  strength and range and finding one that suits your preference is important when hunting for resources while you can fight monsters around town  there are hazardous ruins  combat heavy zones  but you ll need to spend a pretty hefty amount of stamina and time to enter each floor and  naturally  some items cannot be found anywhere else https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2977251157 h1   criticisms   h1 being an early access game means you ll inevitably run into glitches  the one i ve seen the most often is npcs having trouble with certain spots and getting stuck  but there are nastier glitches  as of this writing  like abandoned ruins not having any breakable terrain or fov glitches  or the world map in the menu disappearing altogether the loading time for the game s startup is very long  especially as you progress more in the game and it can easily pass the 3 minutes mark  which is a lot and indicates somewhat poor optimization the bigger changes to the game s core mechanics  the machinery  come in the form of inconveniences like needing water to keep machines working  your machines getting clogged with sand and sandstorms that can cause problems like blowing away your completed resources from your machines  but it s an  all take  no give  situation with zero upsides to you most cooked foods which normally  in this type of game  should help recover stamina don t do it most of the time   and when they do they restore a piddly amount  or have a only a short lived status buff  30 seconds   this gives you little to no incentive to invest in cooking   unless you re aiming to use said cooked food as gifts   especially since most recipes require a lot of ingredients and time to make  i a lot of skills feel very underwhelming  i   for instance  every skill meant to conserve stamina or resources  or increase productivity have very low chances to activate being at 3 10  range  with one exception being at 20   it s understandable that they don t want you to have infinite stamina  or be swimming in resources in your first month  but most skills are hardly helpful at all characters  while having an impressive amount of reactions for many types of gifts  don t have a lot of  day to day random dialogue and might start repeating their lines soon and often another issue   inherited  from the previous game  is that the random dungeons still have little variety and you ll notice the same layouts repeating themselves while combat has more weapon variety it feels somewhat clunky and repetitive  still lacking depth despite its new mechanics  the camera also can close in suddenly if there s a map object nearby  which can get you blindsided  something that happens fairly often in spars  h1   final thoughts  is it worth it   h1 so far  so good  the amount of content is very good for a game one year in early access  but this is still a diamond in the rough that still needs a lot of polishing even though i feel that my time at sandrock sticks a bit too close to its original formula  i see the  i  more of the same  but done better   i  design choice in a positive light this game easily has the potential to surpass its predecessor  but we can only wait and hope for the best for now hopefully this game won t end as a half baked game deemed complete like some early

between humans2 and elves1   my world has 8 factions  2 of each race   one of the only survivors i can find after the war is a female human warrior   she had many positive combat traits which earned her 92 kills   to reward this ultimate warrior i gave her a secluded opening in the mountains to let her live out the rest of her days  in peace  away from the other 6 factions   after a few weeks the female warrior has managed to start a village on her own   impressed  i decide to reward her efforts by placing a few trees  stones and berry bushes  i want to see how far she can go   weeks later i notice the population of her kingdom has risen to 2    turns out she was pregnant during the war and fought to victory while carrying    she gives birth to a healthy son   i now have an isolated village only capable of reproducing through inbreeding   i get a horrible idea to turn the warrior into some sort of hive mother   give her every fertility   perk so she gets pregnant as fast as possible   give her every attraction increasing perk so she is irresistible to her children   give her every age increasing   immortality perks   make her completely disease  illness and infection resistant with the immune perk   give every perk that increases her number of children   i let that cook for a few years and come back to the village at a population of 6   the mother and her first born son now have 4 children of their own  great news   the additional villagers spur on an age of prosperity and more inbreeding   the village grows to a population of just under 30 and stagnates   limited by the size of the clearing amongst the mountains   this population cap fluctuates and levels out for years on end   the warrior queen can do nothing as generations of her children grow old and die   during game play i noticed that after being abducted at the end of her war  our female warrior has spent the entire time either sad or angry   about 300 years later the village is still going strong  the queen is aged 340 and has had about 100 children   i get a new idea  possibly sicker in nature   i infect every villager with the plague   this lowers a number of stats  but most importantly   negative 10000  fertility   negative max children  10   the plague does not infect the warrior queen due to her immune perk   the villagers can now no longer reproduce amongst themselves and need the queen involved to have more children   whenever a male villager knocks up the queen and she again gives birth  the child immediately contracts the plague   queue 2000 years of prosperity and inbreeding   i ve turned a noble human warrior into a hermit  into a mother  into a village chief  into a queen and finally into an over 2000 year old baby factory with a thousand offspring   she is still sad  still angry   i decide my work here is done and let the poor woman just have her oven used and destroyed  on end  for potentially forever   meanwhile i was slowly interacting with the other 6 factions   building them up  breaking them down   unleashing disasters  unleashing nukes   forcing peace  forcing war   just normal worldbox things   then thanks to sonic speed   afk  12000 years passed  2 factions remained after the time skip  orcs1 and orcs2  as per usual   i force them to wage war   after some time orcs1 have orcs2 on the ropes   before the final battles can commence i start a zombie outbreak and it steals the victory from orcs1   all the remaining orcs are now zombies and they spread out across the map infecting all other life   nothing remains of the living   except the one isolated village in the mountains   14 000 years have passed since this lady was born and she accomplished something amazing    she learnt how to pass on her perks through birth  among her thousands of children she managed to pass on her immunity perk   reproducing with her children who also had the perk  increased the chance for plague immune offpsring   the queen eventually eliminated the plague and had a 30 pop village all with immunity perk   along with this  the queen also passed on her fighting perks from the war    in the same manner as the immunity perk  through 1000 s of years of inbreeding  she created an ultimate warrior race   30 warriors with vastly increased damage  armor  crit chance  speed   immunity   i release the 30 villagers into the zombie infected world   the proud 30 with their queen fight off hordes of zombies day and night   in the time between zombie kills  the humans repopulate with more immune children  spreading humanity behind a retreating zombie army   eventually the humans win the war and retake the land  glorious victory   a world ravaged by war for as long as it could remember was saved by an unlikely hero    an unhappy

it  definitely not if you don t  read on for more info let s talk about the  don t  first   the base offering of the game  one of the coolest playstyles for a rhythm game involving swinging sabers like you re out of star wars  moving your body around to avoid walls and swinging your wrists to avoid bombs  being engrossed in a simplistic but easy on the eye and aesthetically intriguing world  functionally  the game plays very well and you re going to be burning some calories if you play on hard   you get a decent amount  i think around 35   of songs to play around with  multiplayer functionality  an in game level editor  a campaign mode and more  the songs are alright at best  annoying at worst  everyone s taste is different  there s a lot of electronica  some hip hop esque music  some rock  and a couple others  only angel voices and escape stuck with me more importantly though  how s the mapping with respect to the music  it s okay if you re playing on hard or less  but my overall experience in expert and higher is they don t feel like there s good flow  like some note placement feels like you have to make an unnatural movement or they trick you to lose your combo  not all songs are like this  and the more recent free osts show they have gotten a bit better with the mapping  the campaign mode seemed neat  and i started on that to get introduced to the game  it starts off easy  challenging you with restrictions or getting a minimum combo score progressively  but then they have some weird counterintuitive tasks like  swing your arms for 900m  where i was using any free gap between notes to swing my arms ridiculously hoping to hit the 900m goal  or weird stuff like  don t get beyond a 25 combo  in a way to manage your energy levels i guess  i did 100  the campaign  but beyond the first few levels  i can t recommend it unless you really want the achievements lastly  let s talk about how the game stands now in 2023  plenty more rhythm games have come out since  and pretty much all of them are cheaper than this  bs never goes on sale  they patch the game every so often to add a few dlc songs  which are also not cheap unless you get one of their rotating dlc bundles  at  2 a song  if you buy 15 non discounted songs  you re basically paying for the game again but for significantly less content  i get it  licensing isn t cheap  but from what i ve read the dlcs are very hit or miss with their mapping  and some songs are censored without any way to change that  ridiculous  if you want to do that to make it age accessible  fine  but at least give us adults a damn toggle  and yes  i get this pricing practice is kind of standard for a lot of rhythm games  including one i strongly recommend  synth riders   but come on  in 2023  there are so many other games that offer a better or unique package  synth riders  ohshape  audio trip  which got overhauled recently   boombox  powerbeatsvr  all of these games are cheaper  go on sale have discounts  don t muck up your game with patches that add paid songs no one wants  and to those that care  aren t affiliated with facebook  meta   do i recommend them all  personally  no  but your experience may be better than mine  give em a look  especially synth riders  that one is probably the best  unless   let s talk about modded beat saber  you know how whenever a vr game topic comes up  beat saber is almost always mentioned and regarded as a highlight  the modding community is why  it s a grad school thesis level of insane what driven individuals can do  custom sabers  global scoreboard functionality  making and modding a little avatar character to represent yourself  adding a clock  no joke  i genuinely believe every vr game should have some kind of toggleable clock   huge customization to pretty much everything  and of course the custom songs  there are thousands of custom songs  and thanks to the beatmap voting system you can do with custom music and people caring to refine their work  the custom maps are overall superior to anything the base game has  caramelldansen is genuinely one of the best maps i ve ever played in any rhythm game  and it isn t too hard so with a little practice everyone can experience it  again  thousands of songs and a plethora of customization options to give yourself the definitive experience  and the modding setup is so easy even i can do it and i m pretty clumsy with some modding stuff  the additions mods make are what base beat saber should have become  in my opinion  and even though i wrote mostly negative things about the base game  i can t say anything but positive stuff once you get mods setup  right now i think like 85 90  of my playtime comes from modded bs  and since i 100 d the achievements and don t find myself touching anything from base  this   will just keep rising  absolute gold standard in vr rhythm gaming tl dr   mod beat saber  and or get synth

mode  the review also does not cover the challenges for the sake of brevity  keep this in mind as you read it now  i m being honest when i say i don t have much experience in survival or sandbox games  sure  i enjoy a game with interesting mechanics that allow for some kind of sandbox y  creative gameplay such as the grand theft auto or just cause series  but as time passes  i engage less and less with pure sandbox games like the sims or ms flight simulator  i like the idea of having an endpoint to my gaming experience  even if it might take a while to get there or the path might be unclear and undefined  so when i decided to review the long dark  i knew i had to throw away some of my preconceptions and expectations and just go with the flow so i boot up the game and navigate through the main menus until i find the new game option  i chose a difficulty  in my case  the easiest  since i heard the game can be quite unforgiving  and a starting location  the game gives you hints of which ones are good for starters and for lack of a better reason i chose mountain town  and then  it was on  no tutorial  no keymapping  no explanation of the hud  nothing  just my character breathing  and that was enough to freak me out instantly  since i knew my struggle for survival had already started  i pressed random buttons for the first five minutes and tried to figure out what did what  this madness allowed me to get a good  yet basic  grasp of the controls  but i was still confused by the fact i cannot jump and by how clunky it felt to get to the menu and do basic things like change clothes or look at your inventory  while there are radial shortcuts to some actions like having food and drinks or getting light sources out  menus are still your best friend in and out i looked around and saw only snow  there seemed to be a bunch of crows circling overhead and a trailer nearby  which made my destination  and that s when i start to get a feeling of how systems interact   how my stamina gets consumed when i sprint  and how some of the icons on the screen change depending on what i do  for example  i decided to  harvest  a cardboard box outside the trailer   and then suddenly the sun icon on the top right of my screen moved a bit  indicating that time was passing faster as i did that activity  at the same time  the four icons at the bottom started running down   while it wasn t immediately clear  i quickly figured out they represent warmth  fatigue  thirst  and hunger  and that their depletion contributes to your overall  condition   or the way the game represents a health bar you eventually realize this all this information is given to you at the  harvest confirmation  screen  but it certainly takes a while to get used to the icons  screens  and how to consume all that information  i really  really feel that it would be helpful to have at least a mini tutorial telling me how to navigate the world and what to watch out for  but even without that tutorial  after roughly one hour of playtime  i felt that i understood the game basics and could at least survive the first in game day  now   a caveat  some people told me the story mode is basically an extended tutorial for the survival mode  and i would love to be exposed to that tutorial  but as mentioned above  the version i m playing doesn t include the story mode  so that doesn t help me  i m still a bit baffled that a complex game like that doesn t include a tutorial  but let s move on  a few days later  in real life   i booted the game again for my second gaming session  now with 90 minutes of gameplay and some basic understanding under my belt  and it was only now that the magic of the game really started showing  for starters  i was finally able to get away from my puny trailer and start exploring  while the game graphics are not realistic  they are beautiful   the nature is stunning yet intimidating  the buildings feel old and dilapidated  but still better than the outside  and the whole landscape comes together really nicely  weather effects look good and provide useful information   blowing wind with lots of snowflakes and low visibility not only look good but are probably good indicators that a blizzard is coming or already arrived  this  combined with great sound effects  from the wind blowing to cloth tearing  makes the experience very immersive venturing a bit further from camp took me to the town of milton  where i could start looting the houses  finding better gear and supplies  and becoming even bolder in my adventuring  when you finally start exploring  the mechanics of the game become second nature and you enter a flow state   you re not thinking too much about every microdecision on your day like what to eat or where  but instead  you can start focusing on macro stuff   what s the condition of your clothes  do you need any special items like cured leather to repair your boots  and if so  where can you find them  can you start mapping your surroundings  should you try to stock those heavy batteries  today s weather looks fine  should you drop your parka so you can move faster and carry more stuff  is it gross outside but you spent too much time inside and need to avoid cabin fever  how long are you going to stay in milton  and when you decided to leave  where will you head towards reaching that zen  that flow state  is extremely satisfying and somewhat easy to achieve on the easiest difficulty  yet it s super engaging and addicting  2 3 hour sessions fly by as you re exploring freeform  without a clear objective but self driven to explore further  i imagine higher difficulties make the experience less zen  but part of that flow state is maintained by your knowledge of the game systems and mechanics my first  run  in the game lasted a bit over six hours split over four real life gaming sessions  covering 13 days of in game time  i was able to explore what i think it s a decent chunk of mountain town  and even head toward forlorn muskeg  an area that is absolutely more difficult than mountain town   while the former has roads  lots of solid ground to navigate around lakes  resources aplenty  and buildings that provide shelter every hundreds of meters  the latter is a patchwork of frozen lakes that are ready to break at any time  resources are scarce and hard to come by  timberwolves roam the land and you can always hear them getting closer  and you almost never find a building after spending a few days looting the town of milton and gathering what i now recognize was way too much food  cloth  and wood  i was too heavy and encumbered and my fatigue was draining too quickly  once i reached forlorn muskeg  i noticed the days were getting short because my character was getting tired too quickly  and i had no reliable source of potable water  while i could probably have survived a bit longer  i woke up one night and saw that an aurora was going on  and i decided to try to explore some nearby radio towers  knowing that they usually hold secrets if you can visit them during an aurora and interact with its electronic devices  but  i stepped on thin ice on my way there  my clothes got soaked  i ran out of fuel for my fire  which was put out by a blizzard  and before i noticed  i embraced the long dark  do i regret leaving the safety of my shelter with less than ideal environmental conditions  encumbered  and with little fuel for fire  absolutely  but this is the kind of risk taking that makes journeys in the long dark have meaning and have stakes  and how emergent stories are created  and i m looking forward to starting the game again  in a different place  with a different world around me  a different inventory  and a different set of emergent objectives  this is what

game  but i still have some hours into it i do really like this game in a lot of ways  the premise is different than i m used to and its really wonderful  dreadful  hopeless and exciting  i would not describe it as similar to frost punk when it comes to emotional impact  there s a special kind of hopelessness baked into ixion that frostpunk could not achieve  purely by being in space rather than trapped in a frozen hellscape  i mean  your still on earth in frostpunk  its familiar and there is hopefulness that s couched in the brutality  but ixion tears away any safety net by depriving you of a planet entirely and leaving you wondering if there s any point to continuing onward tl dr 10 10 bad  sad vibes  posthat said  mechanically it s a mixed bag  i m perfectly fine with city builder survival games that want to crush you under their boot    but ixion doesn t seem to quite reach the threshhold of satisfying challenge  for example  frostpunk has a lot of scenerios you can play though  some of them i adore because they re brutal but ultimately really satisfying  sitting on the edge of my seat praying to make it through another freeze and feeling the triumph of actually making it out alive but some of the scenerios are so crushing that the challenge outweighs the satisfaction  and for me that comes mostly in the form of demanding too much when i m already managing too many resources i think in a similar way  ixion grazes that satisfaction challenge balance but falls short when it comes to a few things  at first its manageable  but as soon as you open up sectors it immediately becomes a task of figuring out how to completely reformat your city plan to account for that sector  and the stress of keeping your ship from falling apart increases while your contending with the laborious task of trying to figure it out    which is even more stressful because it introduces more and more materials and resources to be managed at the same time i wish there was an option to try and set up the new sector a little bit before officially opening it  but i think too that the system for managing different sectors is not communicated spectacularly well  so you have a bit of confusion weighing you down  in short  the mechanics are a bit messy and obtuse  but from what i can tell they have been improving on that  so hopefully it ll continue to do so  lastly  there is another part of ixion that is so so so close to being extremely compelling  but falls just short of it  the exploration encounters  the things that you find out there are extremely cool  and the descriptions are appropriately mysterious  again  the writers did a primo job on the story and vibes but it doesn t quite hit  and i think its because it feels more like you are witnessing a phenomenon and the decisions you make about the things you find have impact    but it doesn t seem to be super significant maybe that changes later on  but i think the problem is coming into the first act of the game having had a very significant effect at the beginning  setting your expectations up for your actions having severe and unintended side effects  and then instead of your choices being intense  sweat inducing decisions that have long lasting impact  you kinda just say  whoopsie  guess i need another medical center   and then the problem is effectively erased  the successes are also kind of underwhelming in a similar way i think a really excellent example of an impeccable punishment reward system is an early access title called  against the storm   that game is fundimentally different from most other city builders in that it is more of a    village builder  you have a tight schedule to achieve as many resources as you can in as short a time as you can  while also factoring in a number of different assets that can put you ahead of the difficulty curve  it doesn t require you to live with your decisions long term so  while i am making a comparison  i don t want to imply that ixion is a lesser because it is an ever expanding city builder  that s what i want from it i just think its reward system is really something to pay attention to regardless  because it is a game that will absolutely screw you if you don t think things through and remain flexible  every time you venture into a new area  there is this palpable feeling of excitement and anxiety  because each new area you find is going to have something in it worth the effort    but there s also always something in there that s going to punish you  i really love that system  the punch of knowing that  no matter what you find you are also going to have to contend with some kind of challenge makes the process of exploration extremely compelling  and i think ixion could easily have that  i hope if when they add new scenerios  they implement more impactful exploration  because i think that could really benefit the game in the end  i do reccommend ixion  its a worthwhile experience regardless of how much time you spend with it  it has so much potential  but it feels like its a bit lost and a little shy to take full advantage of the scenerio they

twisted and malformed by an ominous transmission  running down what seems like an endless hallway  chased by a darkness he can never seem to escape but it is all just a nightmare  as he soon awakens from this dream to the sound of static from a nearby tv  hissing at him aggravatingly as if it has a mind of his own  until it shuts down abruptly  leaving mono in silence to take in his new surroundings https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3146816052mono finds himself in an all encompassing woodland  where he must cautiously bypass many traps hidden from him amongst the gnarled and rotting trees  after journeying a short distance  mono comes across a cabin  and within its creaking halls  he rescues a young girl  together  they find themselves face to face with the cabin owner  who is displeased by the interruption with the girl in tow  they narrowly escape his clutches and begin their long travels through warped ruins  brimming with many horrors and abominations that seek to cut their journey short as they search endlessly for the origins of the signal that has ripped the world apart the story of little nightmares 2 has been impeccably designed and thought out to consistently push your expectations and keep you on the edge of your seat  with a new protagonist to lead the way and an eerily familiar companion by your side  you will have a lot of things to discover as you traverse the suspenseful journey in search of answers or perhaps just more questions  h1 gameplay analysis  h1  h3 same world  new rules   h3 before i start  i want to state that there isn t a lot of mechanical complexity to this game  and this section will be relatively short  considering that first and foremost  though  i want to touch on the movement  as this was a pretty considerable gripe of mine in the original game  and it is essentially the most improved aspect of the experience  obviously  being able to navigate the world is going to play a substantial part in your travels  in little nightmares 2  this has been vastly improved to feel responsive and will very seldom cause you much frustration in general  which all in all is a massive win to the original clunky control system that caused more deaths than i care to admit the general physics is enhanced so that gravity and surface tension play a more extensive role in pushing or dragging objects across terrain  be careful  however  as sound plays a more significant part in this game  and you will have to circumvent some enemies while other noises cover your movements https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3146816542light is more of a weapon now  as many enemies in this world will only be able to chase you within the dark  and utilising your flashlight will play a more meaningful role than before in trying to avoid their grasp  h3 not as helpless in a hopeless situation   h3 something to consider on your travels is that mono isn t anywhere near as helpless as six was in the first game  being able to carry weapons to defend himself and his hands being unburdened by keys are two of the most meaningful changes to the experience that came to mind as i played through the story in a similar vein  mono is also more merciful  as numerous times during the game  you will be given the choice of letting something  live  despite the grievance they have caused  and this is clearly an intended move by the developers to make you realise there s more to mono than meets the eye and to make you consider the pain already evident  prior to pulling the trigger  h3 in all the dark places of this land   h3 lastly  exploration did not play an enormous role in the first game  but in ln2  it is far more consequential as a secret ending awaits those who seek out the collectibles hidden in the many obvious and hidden places across the campaign  h1 audio and visual  h1 the visuals are vastly improved compared to the original  particularly with the implementation of the enhanced edition  the world is stunning to observe  and you will notice that physics and light play a far more impressive role here than ever before  shining and reflecting your torch off surfaces and the realistic rippling of water as you wade through it are just some gorgeous details you will expect to see on your journey https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3146817198the audio has been designed to the same degree  with a nostalgic soundtrack to keep the story cosy as it unravels before your eyes  and coupled nicely with the eerie and well paced atmosphere that each new zone brings  h1 deck performance and specifications  h1 little nightmares 2 on the steam deck performs much like you can imagine  as it is a moderately slow paced and

just when i thought i d dredged the best from that pool  in the very next run a shiny new toy would drop with glittering fanfare and i d race to bank it with the collector and though it may sting when you have to say goodbye to those perfect turrets that helped you progress further than ever before   the ones that set victims ablaze and do double damage to burning enemies in tandem   or the tens of thousands of gold you ve collected on a particularly bountiful run  the actual progression comes from unlocking buffs  skills  and weapons between each run that never go away   no matter how often you thrust your face into walls of spikes while trying to set a new land speed record in the ancient sewers but through that constant repetition  like being trapped in some kind of gothic horror groundhog day  you ll scrape together money  blueprints for new items  and cells you can spend to unlock blueprints and buffs for future use  each small bit of persistent power you pick up propels you forward like a bloody snowball careening down a mountain until you feel unstoppable  h1 speed demon  h1   momentum is where dead cells really shines  its slick system of running  jumping  dodging  and pounding through these dungeons feels so good that the desire to move and attack quickly overrides a lot of the caution that comes with a game where death sends you back to the beginning  i motion twin s  i  subtle design pushes you forward through ingenious touches  you re rewarded for multi kills with a burst of movement speed to keep propelling you forward  you don t take damage from colliding with enemies  only their attacks inflict harm  and that grants a sense of safety even in the presence of diverse and deadly foes  if you re wily enough  move fast enough  or jump precisely enough  you re untouchable dead cells  movement and combat encourage you to put it all on the line to get a little farther  it s meant to be replayed dozens of times  unlocking another small but significant fragment of the broad skillset with each new artifact you earn  once you ve unlocked all of the clever metroid style abilities you re eventually able to move unrestricted through dead cells  darkest recesses to uncover its skimpy  but fun  bits of story and cleverly hidden game references in secret areas there s a genuine sense that the secrets hiding near the end of dead cells  journey are as potent as those you re able to unlock near the start  finding a rune in the acidic pits of the toxic sewers changed my first 15 minutes of every run thereafter  i now had access to a hefty portion of new equipment  secret areas  and alternate routes that were once unreachable  there was almost a rush in dying because it meant i could dive back into the opening minutes to uncover something i previously couldn t  that feeling carries over with each new artifact  especially after discovering what s on the other side of the final boss  h1 improv  improve  h1   the real diversity in each run comes from an excellent set of choices in how you want the second to second gameplay to work  perhaps you ll blitzkrieg through with speed and fire and sword   you ll be rewarded for your reckless pace with access to timed locking gates that only open if you reach them in their stingily allotted times  or maybe you ll go through dead cells methodically  using ranged weapons  traps  and turrets to safely pierce  poison  burn  or butcher enemies and thoroughly explore every inch of each level for treasure  you ll be stronger for it these playstyles are changeable on the fly  too  thanks to dead cells  smart system for powering up throughout a run by collecting scrolls of power  in the beginning  you re weak and fragile  but as you collect these scrolls you ll be able to choose a build based on your style and items  the catch is that building an aspect buffs its associated weapons and skills and it s also how you increase your maximum health pool the more scrolls you dump into a specific aspect  the less overall health you get for each consecutive one  so if you want to play a headless beefcake capable of taking a blow  it s wise to spread your points out  however  doing so means you re not particularly powerful with any one set of items  so your damage likely won t be enough to whittle down the ever inflating enemies in the later levels  i love that in dead cells you are free to experiment  but you don t quite know how it will all shake out  your starting weapons  the items you pick up  and their modifiers are always different  it keeps you improvising after all of the experimenting  the one overarching strategy i discovered was that you can t always go for the throat  my first 10 runs in dead cells were all aimed directly at the final boss  but i quickly realized spending over an hour to get there only to immediately die because i hadn t properly prepared was a waste of effort  my revised strategy was to focus on extracting blueprints for new gear in some runs  and on harvesting cells to unlock those items and buffs in others  and every once in a while  i d just run like a madman with a death wish and explore as much as possible for a more dramatic change of pace  there s a daily dungeon outside of your main campaign that tosses you into a random map with random pickups to see how fast you can kill the boss  and  like all things in dead cells  this mode also rewards permanent progression  in the form of blueprints  for consecutively clearing these challenges each day  it s a fun distraction and gives you the chance to test out gear you ve yet to find in your game  h1 conclusion  h1   overall  dead cells is rewarding in its flexibility in a way few games are  each easily digestible run through its beautifully detailed and shifting levels instills a feeling of discovery and familiarity  it goads you to push the limits of your ability and mercilessly crushes you when you get too comfortable  there are layers of strategy and tactics buried not only in the immediate choices you make  but in the grander metagame each run builds toward  it resembles a triumphant union of instinct  forethought  fun  and failure  h1  b

is  so rich and deep  a painstakingly crafted ocean of unforgiving brutality  so many easy rogue likes out there softened my meek and tender body only to play barony and die to rats in level 1 of this masterpiece  so many interesting interconnecting systems at play here to take into consideration when entering the mine  h1 the quality durability system   h1  that moldy apple looks way more appetizing when you re starving to death  your weapon of choice might not last you too long without carefully deciding how many backups you should feasibly carry at the cost of space and movement speed  this system is used to make you agonize over what to use and carry and it belongs here because it s done intelligently as a means to curb your success and temper your risk assessment  you will be tested and you will fail  this is the first hurdle in barony and as a familiar mechanic in games it s used well enough to kill you at any point in the game  h1 the appraisal system   h1  an absolute gem of a game mechanic  you must start early by identifying simple foods even if you don t need to eat  otherwise you ll don an amulet that chokes you to death and can t be removed because it s cursed but you didn t know that because you didn t hold a piece of cheese until you learned it s age and backstory  this mitigates the number of items you can use in a run by essentially making a large portion of them completely off limits if you want to live long enough to die to a boulder in the next 30 seconds  conversely  nurturing your ability to identify items allows you safe r  access to run saving loot and makes you feel like you earned the right not to die for the next 30 seconds  cursed and blessed items are both commodities for your party and a single misuse can hamper you for hours or completely kill you  you will learn not to equip anything you can t appraise  but before that point  you will die regretting your hubris  h1 the player races   h1  this system really starts to shine in multiplayer mode where the needs of the party and the loot of the world truly create a brilliant type of synergy  if only one player needs food  another needs blood  the third eats kindling  and the last eats nothing then you all have the unique ability to help each other survive and interact with different aspects of the game  conversely  a party of four hungry humans is a run where the probable cause of a team wipe is a lot less likely to be combat  synergy is so essential here and i truly love how the races can work together or against themselves if chosen poorly  i love taking my time and needing nothing so i really love being a skeleton  i feed my party and this allows me to play at a slower pace  look at those mortals  how they want for sustenance  pathetic  h1 the class stat system   h1  no class is equipped to handle every threat or excel in every facet  some classes aren t even centered around combat  the late game trajectory of your build is malleable and your focus should change based on what your party can feasibly bring to the table  in multiplayer my absolute favorite class is the merchant  merchants can t really fight well but if your party helps you max out the trading skill and you start selling gems you essentially win the game if you can finesse the shop owners before your party starves to death waiting for you to buy  appraise and then sell everything in the universe  plus your build is essentially whatever you want with an emphasis on utility  merchants are ducks  they walk  they fly  they swim  they do a little bit of everything without doing anything extremely well  yet they still have their unique niche being allied to all shops regardless of race  like  how cool is that  every class has a place somewhere  while the party all dies in their petty squabbles we merchants get comfortable counting the coin from our hauls  and with our opulence we fund the war effort and make victory not a question of  if   but  what do i get out of it  i really only wanted to touch on these fundamental surface level systems because that s what you re presented with starting out in barony  i really appreciate them for what they are and how they re done  i really want you to appreciate them too  the rest like enchanting  brewing  tinkering  magic  stealth  damage resistances and vulnerabilities  unique items  alternate floors  followers  techs  skill grinding techniques  etc  those are all deeper in the game and worth carefully mastering to improve your odds of success and will enrich your experience deeply i really love barony and want to see it become everything it deserves to be  i find myself charmed by its game play and aesthetics  every death makes me want for more  thank you turning wheel for making a game that reminds me why i love rogue likes  every wipe makes me say  what a game",2024-02-27,2024-02-27,True,84,2,0.870937168598175049,0,True,False,False

and you need to know it is not a complete game   there is a fair deal in the game that is not finished   no  it is not like the stuff is completed and waiting for a dlc to expand on it   it is flat out incomplete for example you can have children in game but they do not grow up   i consider that complete   them growing up can be a future dlc or patch or something   however things like the merfolk who are in game are incomplete   you meet them  they show up in the list of people you meet  but you can not gain any affinity with them and none of them ever really seem to have anything to say   they really seem to have no purpose in the game  outside of some story line progressing  and there is no real reason for them to even be in the game as it is   this is an incomplete addition to the game and one of many examples where i say the game is still in beta and is not ready to be called a  release  game   can t have an entire  city  in the game with mostly nothing to do in it and call the game complete so with that said  buy the game if you like farming sims  it is still enjoyable as that   but it seems like the game is only 80  finished so understand it is not a complete game in any sense   buy the game as a beta game and consider it early access  because that is what it is   and being it is only 80  complete i suggest only buying it at 80  price or lower if you can   pay for what you are getting and not what they are promising you will come later example of things that are incomplete   maybe the devs will read so they can get some ideas on what needs to be worked on sprinkler attachments   only works sometimes   seeds it is better at and gets most of the time but fertilizer  it is 50 50   you always have to check to see if it did what it was supposed to   i have never  repeat never  had it add fertilizer to every patch   i always need to clean up after it auto chest   another 50 50 addition to the game   works awesome 3 or 4 days in a row and then suddenly stops working   leaves completed items in the machine and you need to fetch them yourself   does not reload machines when it has materials   only used 2 of the 4 aging barrels   you get it  they never work completely speech   3 times i had someone refer to me as  playername    macy on more then one occasion has told me how much she loves being married to me   while sweet  my actual wife lily might be upset about that   lily one morning asked me what she should bring to the fair tomorrow when the fair was next week cut scenes   only happened once but still   when the town reached rank a i had the big cut scene to celebrate reaching rank a   about 7 days later i had the same exact cut scene celebrating the town reaching rank a   didn t we do this already writing   it seems at times it is incomplete or they hired an overly emotional teenager with no real life experience to write the parts   for example in one cut scene leah professes her love for me and i am given two options to reply   option one  i feel the same and option two  i don t feel the same   there is no option 3 that there really should have been one for  even more so that when asked this from her i was already married   when i say i only want to be friends she runs off crying   where is the third option  you know the one that should be in game because i ve been married to lily for 2 seasons   one that says something along the lines of  i really like you but i love my spouse    now you see why i said a child wrote the options   no adult option to let the person down easy   not convinced   many times in cut scenes you are asked things to give your response and the only options you are given are disrespectful answers or smart ass answers   like one with mark and a dog  your only 2 options are be rude and be really rude  how about one to be supportive of someone trying to help a stray   only crappy disrespectful answers that a kid trying to sound  cool  would give speaking of writing   every errand you do gets the responce  thank you    seriously   you could not write a few random responses for it and cycle through them   back to letting the kid write this   where is the   i ve been looking for this  or the  i can now make the soup i ve been craving        build the trap to catch that butterfly        make the wine   etc  you get the idea   something instead of a basic and bland  thank you  every single time would be nice  basically writing as a whole is incomplete and not completely proofed   also letting an editor look over it would have told you some responses are just completely lifeless  the writing is basic and incomplete in a great many parts of the game npcs   there are so many that have nothing to say   if they have nothing to say stop with showing me there is something to say   nothing more annoying them clicking to talk to someone and getting  they have nothing more to say  or  you don t understand what they are saying   if they have nothing to say or i don t understand what they have to say do not give the speech option at all   you are wasting the players time and no one likes that useless areas   the deep forest with the monkey   outside of finding some scavenables and a lot of hardwood it has no reasons to be there   it is completely unfinished   the peak at the top you can get to somewhat early breaking the boulder   i ve run up it at least 30 times   nothing to pick on the ground  no insects to capture  can t even fish off the edge  why is it there   the dungeons in the ocean   maybe i just missed something but what the hell is its purpose   just to collect more trash once you clean up the ocean   pet peeve time   we live on an island with the dirtiest most disrespectful of the environment type of people on the face of the earth   i clean the beach  it is dirty the next day   i clean the ocean  the next day it is cluttered with water bottles and tires and all sorts of trash   how the f do these people produce that much garbage every single day   we do no need those ocean dungeons when the pigs on the island will make sure there is always garbage all over the place   seriously  once you open the otherwise useless ocean dungeons trash should stop appearing in the ocean and on the beach   at least that would give those dungeons some reason to exsist  even if a lame one there is more incomplete about the game  but just wanted to point out some of the larger ones i ve noticed   but again  as i said  the game is an early access game and not a complete game as advertised  so when you buy it  keep that in mind   and with all that  yes  i still suggest you buy it   it is a good game   hopefully it will be better when it is finished and actually ready for

until one day the regular  boring  non lethal dawn became the grim dawn  that means  eldritch abominations started pouring out from various dimensional orifices  consequently bludgeoning humanity s  own  orifices real quick  it s actually a lot more nuanced than that  but you get the idea  along this not so original premise  you happen to be a nobody left for dead  who is given a second chance to become the hero of the hour thanks to their unique situation there s actually a surprising amount of lore for an arpg  scattered around in many forms ranging from notes to dialogues  descriptions of items and so forth  even if story and worldbuilding aren t usually the centerpieces of an arpg  those interested in them will find enough material to satisfy their inner bookworm  the writing itself is more than passable  the voice acting indeed a nice touch to give emphasis to conversations  unfortunately  the characters themselves rarely stand out or become memorable  as most of them feel generic and cliched   but that s not as bad for this kind of game  anyway visually  the world is detailed and diverse enough  care was evidently put in building each location  even if at times the sheer size of them will make orienteering difficult due to the labyrinthine nature of map layouts  immersion is high thanks to a fitting soundtrack and quality effects in all fields   considering their age  of course h3 exploration   secrets  h3 the world of cairn is entirely open  and divided in several named areas you can traverse freely  although to proceed  in many cases  you ll have to complete the main quest first  most locations are extensive and elaborate in layout  although they become more linear towards the end of the main campaign  many secrets such as hidden chests  secret quests  optional dungeons and even hidden bosses await the keen explorer  these may not always be super rewarding  but you never know when you ll hit the loot jackpot indeed  spending time to comb each centimeter is rewarding in many ways  the handy minimap and global maps are a boon  although they don t always save markers correctly or at all  which makes backtracking to discovered locations more annoying  and the global map lacks the transparency layout expected in an arpg  mobs will not respawn until the session is closed and remade  overall  the exploration component feels fun and rewarding  with the sense of mystery and discovery being higher than the average arpg  map layouts can be excessively convoluted at times  and you ll definitely have to google some obscure quest locations  but overall a solid experience  h3 combat system   bosses  h3 the combat of grim dawn is fast paced and dynamic  with all characters having a default dodge move to avoid enemy projectiles  hits and aoe  while many other mobility skills can be acquired from items or class specific progression  kiting enemies around  especially against stronger ones  while also dealing damage and dodging will be a common experience  as not everything can be tanked or faced with the same strategy  on higher difficulties  expect a great amount of one shots if you play a less resilient class such as a rogue  ranger or caster dps  which i did   the playstyle heavily differs between each class combination  but ultimately  everyone has to be mobile  dodge and pay attention to enemy attacks to survive  aggro rules make it so that whoever does the highest dps often gets targeted  so tanks won t be as useful there s a staggering amount of unique modifiers specific to dungeons  affixes  enemy variants  abilities and gear specific buffs that the combinations of what could happen on the field  and most importantly what you can make happen  are nearly endless  most high tier enemies and bosses have unique movesets or even evolving phases  which isn t something you see in all diablo style arpgs  you won t get bored  as it usually could happen  by the repetitive nature of foes  as even a second playthrough with the same classes has a lot of surprises in this regard  on the demanding ultimate difficulty  h3 character progression   crafting  h3 your classic arpg progression  based on xp leading to skill and attribute points gain  is spiced up by the devotion system in grim dawn  as you progress and explore  finding altars will grant you points to improve your dedication to the various gods of the world  which in turn grant you a variety of passive bonuses  these culminate in powerful  unique passives that can be combined with active abilities of your class  so that they trigger as you use them  this adds a new layer of depth to the already satisfying character development  respecs are quite cheap and  most importantly  unlimited  even for attributes and devotions as

give me just a little  set amount of spells i can use  like most games do  but rather a place where to do magic  to create my own  years later noita does that  and much more wand tinkering  and spells in general  would require a review on their own  there are around 380 spells in the base game  and 422 in the current beta branch  update  beta branch went live two days after this   and most of them  if not all  are interesting in their own right  the amount of things you are allowed to do is immense  do you want a wand that casts angry boulders  ready to fly onto any and every enemy they see  crushing them to their death  not only it s doable  but it only requires you to use two spells  perhaps you d like a wand that shoots nukes     at the same rate a machine gun shoots its stuff  i wouldn t recommend it  your pc probably wouldn t like it  but it doesn t hurt to try once    or twice  or how about using a spell that kills  read  destroy  any enemy within range  the range being your entire screen  just like that  as if they were disappearing because you ve snapped your fingers  such spell exists of course  some spells are better than others  and some require better wands to be casted  but noita works in mysterious ways  and with the right set of spells  even the most humble ones can become weapons of mass destruction always cast wands add lots of fun and new ideas to the mix  every time you cast any spell from said wand  the spell  or spells  you can have multiple always casts  will get casted as well  a good always cast spell can and will change your run  although they re fairly rare to come by the complexity of wand tinkering is definitely not something that i can fully cover  because even now  283 hours into the game  i still feel like i ve barely scratched its surface  noita does that pretty well  making me feel like i m still learning something new  every single run  for those who are interested  youtube is full of tutorials on how to maximise damage  on which spells you want to look for  on which synergise well    personally i ve always avoided them  spending time tinkering is a key component to my enjoyment of the game  and sharing the results with some of the friends that play the game makes it even more satisfying alchemy  or as a friend of mine likes to call it  shampoo making  definitely deserves a mention as well  alongside potions in general  note that when i say alchemy  i am referring only to the act of potion mixing  and not the concept of alchemy as a whole  with all its references to real life  more on that later  noita has a big variety of potions  liquids and materials going on  and lots of them interact with each other  from mixing acceleratium  a liquid that makes you go faster  and levitatium  a liquid that lets you levitate faster  together to create hastium  a liquid that will let you both move and levitate faster  to creating an alchemical wonder that will turn everything it touches into gold  alchemy comes in different degrees of complexity  just like wand tinkering then  you can spend hours upon hours messing around with liquids  trying to conoct something new and interesting while updating a spreadsheet open where you save your discoveries  mixing acceleratium with slime isn t a good idea  heating up water will create smoke  setting a small pixel of oil on fire will eventually turn the whole pool of oil into fire  throwing blood on lava will create volcanic rock  and so on  chances are i ve never seen every single potion in the game  since i ve happened to stumble across liquids i had never seen before not too long ago  the current beta branch is adding some more liquids as well  one of which is a game changer when it comes to alchemy  and will make mixing potions easier and more fun for the potions to have an effect on you you don t necessarily have to stain yourself with them  since the game also has a drink  and eat  mechanic  of course  drinking some potions and liquids isn t a good idea  why would you drink your flask of acid    but the option is always there  you can also eat some materials  eating some things in certain quantities might also make    interesting things happen  so go ahead and consume everything you see  if it does you good  good for you  and if does you bad  at least you ve learnt something new i ll never be able to stress enough the importance of learning from your mistakes in noita  the whole point of the game is to learn  learn which spells are good and synergise well  learn which potions you always want to have with you  learn which enemies are best avoided  what they do  learn what perks do  and which are best  exploring the world is incredibly fun  its main structure remains mostly unvaried  you can go down the mountain  trying to get down as much as you can  but it only represents a small amount of the content noita has to offer  there is a whole world to be explored  filled with secrets  enemies  bosses and special wands  in due time  if you re willing to sink time into it  you ll learn how it s structured  how to traverse it  and where to look for anything that might make you stronger  the artwork is amazing  i am in love with it  and i m still disappointed there is no points shop  500 steam points for a noita profile background will be worth it enemies  bosses in particular  will teach you the importance of having different kinds of damage  since some of them are completely immune to certain kinds  while also being weak to others  is it really that surprising that the guy made out of fire dies when thrown water at  a wand you ve made  after hours of careful consideration and hard work to look for the right spells  might turn out to be completely powerless against the boss you meant to fight  and yes  it has happened to me some might complain the game is too harsh on you  and while i don t agree with them  denying it s still harsh would be unfair  the game is harsh  some enjoy calling it  a great self discovery tool for masochists   you will die  a lot  sometimes in frustrating ways  through no fault of yours  sometimes it s so random you ll ask yourself  how am i meant to avoid this    but you will learn how to survive longer  how to avoid dangerous situations  how to heal consistently  how to make the best out of what you have  and  random  deaths will happen less and less  you ll come to hate polymorphine  and enemies that shoot it  they ll make you feel vulnerable even at your strongest  and i like it  you ll never be fully invincible there are also some complaints on the game s secrets  even i felt the game might have been too wiki dependant when i first started  since i just couldn t figure out what some things meant  what they did  how to use them  but the game does give you the means of solving  them  although admittedly a few of them are really obscure   a lot of answers are scattered throughout the world  and when you ll find them  you ll connect the dots  and feel satisfied  and in future runs you ll be able to take advantage of your new found secret  so go ahead and explore the world  your curiosity is rewarded do keep in mind the game is trying to go for a whimsical  esoteric feel  that rewards people willing to take their time and understand what surrounds them  it has plenty of references to alchemy and finnish mythology  the latter i am completely unprepared for  the former i m lucky enough to know things of  watching how the game interprets some of its concepts  the emerald tablet  alchemical symbols     has been very interesting  it also even has its own writing system  and some secrets are yet unsolved  perhaps you ll be the one to solve them try the game out then  give it another try if you ve played it in the past  and keep playing it if you ve never stopped  the game is a harsh teacher  but learning is incredibly fun",2024-04-06,2024-04-09,True,268,7,0.937081694602966309,1,True,False,False

count about 7 hours of play  10 if you aim for the 111  completion  more if you want to do the post game content it plays similarly to momodora  reverie under the moonlight  and takes place after momodora iii if you have missed other titles  the librarian lad in koho village gives you a set of short notes that summarize  and complete   their story and put this one in context way prettier  more polished  and bad ss than its predecessors  including minoria   it also handles better and has more gameplay depth  with the most fun and synergistic perk item system  sigils  and best feeling powercreep in the series it further fleshes out the characters  and does a good job at tieing loose ends and referencing the other games  making it even more enjoyable if you are a momodora fan  momo is virtuous yet a bit sassy  isadora mellowed out despite her fiery temperament  godly beings aren t perfect and make dumb mistakes  and as usual  the game s narrative elegantly slithers between light hearted interactions  gorgeous and whimsical landscapes  and very somber and monstrous events and areas  oh  and so many cats it could be categorized as one of those  find all the cats  games that ve been all the rage lately  i hope you re not allergic there s one nail i must hammer once more  the art direction and world building are absolutely stellar  insane stopping to smell the roses is not really my thing  as my dumb gorilla brain is too too busy trying to brutally annihilate the movement and combat systems of every single game i touch to admire the scenery  but this  this is one of those rare games that make me realize that i  in fact  have been attached with eyes additionally  the soundscape goes perfectly well with it  weaving a mystical and immersive atmosphere in every single region of the game  some tracks are also pretty memorable  with a very strong main leitmotiv and really good boss music the combat is closer to rutm than minoria and it is designed to be enjoyable by both dodgeroll focused players and those who prefer spacing  air control and positioning  oh and i guess filthy  arrow spamming  turtly heathens too but they lost their human rights long ago so who cares level and boss design are extremely varied and will always surprise you  no two bosses or areas are alike and it just never goes stale  i would even say that  b variety is mmf s strongest suit  b  it is not without flaws  however  there are two things that prevent it from being perfect in my eyes first   very minor mechanic spoiler   spoiler  b fast travel  b  not being available for 70  of the game  forcing you to often backtrack over long distances without much to do  especially if you re the type of player who is paranoid about missing things   as the game s level design is that of a  linear   one region at a time metroidvania  think metroid fusion  that focuses on making firsthand exploration feel great at the expense of fun backtracking  typically the kind of game that immensely benefits from having easily accessible warps   spoiler second  and most importantly  difficulty the difficulty curve in mf is more consistent than its predecessors  with perfectly placed spikes that are designed to challenge your gameplan in specific areas each  the problem is  i overall  i  difficulty  and the  b lack of immediate reward for going beyond  b  the challenge if you are new to the series or just not used to this kind of game  it ll feel just fine  heck  it even has a lite mode with togglable adaptive difficulty    however if you re one of those who quickly catch on to how an enemy or bossfight works  you will breeze through the game with little to no death  and left hungry for more  as  b there aren t enough threats  b   in rutm  this was compensated for in the form of an additional reward if you beat a boss without being hit once  here  perfecting a boss feels almost as fun  they are overall easier to cheese  but there is no incentive to it and the game even autosaves after beating some of the bosses  making it impossible to retry if you mistakenly end the fight after taking a hit it still tries to allow you to spice things up  and prevent the aforementioned scenario  in the form of a sigil  spoiler that leaves you at 1hp  spoiler  but there s no point outside of speedrun builds and it takes a precious grimoire slot away   on the other hand  it does provide you with post game content to test your mettle with   spoiler an arrange ng  mode and a hardcore permadeath mode  as well as a boss rush  spoiler   it is just unfortunate that you have to finish the game to get a fitting challenge if you re a brute  a masochist or a fossilized nes snes era monk like me mind you  those are mainly the nitpicks of a seasoned player and most people won t even be affected by them i ve been a fan of the momodora series since the second game  contributed to rutm as a playtester and its french translator  and consider rdein to be my friend  this game was the fruit of much struggle and it came out an absolute beauty   b go and buy it  eyes closed   b  i thank you rdein  and pkbt  paul  nk  as well as hernanz  elektrobear  daku   co  for

bad place a few months back  since the age of 15  i have left china due to some traumatic events  and been going to boarding schools in europe  because of covid  i could not go home for 4 years straight  i did not see my family  and lost touch with my friends  then things turned normal again in 2023  and i went back to china  having to face things from the past one way or another  i met up with my dad  who did not get custody  and whom i have not talked to for around 5 years  at that point  i have been flying leaves  chinese slang for zaza    ofc there was a pause during the trip to china  but it ended the moment i got back to europe  i have started to smoke even more  during the last year of middle school in china  my homeroom teacher publicly humiliated me  in sifu terms  she pulled me out of class into a hallway similar to the one in the squats  i blocked until my structure bar broke  while withstanding enemy taunts  after that  i stopped going to school  in a desperate attempt to still let me have an education  my family decided for europe  where students are not known for committing suicides  or getting caught up in a school shooting  i confronted my mom during my trip to china  asking why they didn t do anything about the teacher  she was shocked  and angry  as it turned out  apparently i had just gone mute since the incident  never told them  and never talked much about anything  maybe so i guess  my memory of that period in life is just a blurry fuzz  after coming back to europe  one day i was scrolling on xiaohongshu  and came across a short video on sifu  i was intrigued by the way it conveyed the process of revenge  and the art style  it just hits such a sweet spot for me  i learned about the story  and the fact that wude is such an important element  here s my thought on a piece of work  a great piece can never be tainted by spoilers  same goes for books and movies  knowing what happens next does not hinder the experience of seeing how it happened  and i wanted to try this game  after smoking  i no longer just lay on the sofa half dead and watch whatever there is on netflix  i was playing sifu instead  i started with the disciple difficulty  and man it was tough  i died so often  i watched some videos  and learned that button mashing doesn t work  i have to stay focused  gradually  i practiced  and died  and practiced  and died less  up to a point where i think weed is getting in my way of improvement  so i quit it  and i progressed faster sober  i first finished the game killing all  because i wasn t able to do it otherwise  and the cut scene   the rage and intensity went through the monitor screen  and i felt every hit of the chain punches  and i went back to attempt the true ending of wude  i must say  after defeating yang  the squats was really a piece of cake  and i practiced  and died  and practiced  and died less  and this time  i know i can do it  patience and focus  that s what jingfeng taught me  when i finally defeated and spared yang  i felt this sense of achievement like never before  it was peaceful  when i got to the top of the mountain and saw the dragon  i saw the protagonist close her eyes  and i also closed my eyes  it s okay  i m at peace   hr   hr as of the time i m writing this review  i m  80hrs in  i have done the wude ending on master difficulty  now i m trying to perfectionize my control  and make every move a conscious decision  i have been mostly playing shooter and racing games before sifu  but once i started sifu  i played nothing else  nothing else feels as rewarding as sifu  even when i achieved platinum rank in r6s  the sense of accomplishment was short lived  maybe due to the prolonged gratification of the sifu experience  i feel content after achieving something  truly rare to come by in a market filled with dopamine  sifu has also made me discover my new love for action games  although nothing else quite hits the same way sifu does  sifu has taught me to just learn from mistakes  and improve  and repeat  and that it s always okay  no matter how tough it originally seemed  at the beginning i used to get frustrated often  my girlfriend said that sometimes she didn t like me playing sifu because i would get upset  but the more i played  the better i got at controlling those emotions  now it s a regular day to just brush it off and try again  there are some issues with authenticity though  sometimes the text looks weird  or looks like midjourney 3 0 text  eg the pendants  the texts don t make much sense apart from the top two  but very minimal  i could go enjoy the experience ignoring them  also could we have  u multiplayer  u  for sifu  pleeeease  i have successfully convinced two friends to play sifu  it would be great if we could play together  pve and pvp like in absolver would both be great  hr   hr i have been clean for a few months now  i have grown to enjoy life as it is  and play sifu  i restarted therapy  this

your body  progressively aging until you are too old to fight  on your path to revenge the only way forward is to master the art of kicking ass  h1 combat  h1 every character  including yours  has both a traditional health bar  as well as a structure bar  equivalent to posture in sekiro   you can defeat any enemy by either depleting their health with plain attacks or damaging their structure  performing blocks at precisely the right time or moves that throw enemies off balance  will increase the structure bar until it s filled up  this will open someone up for a takedown move that instantly kills them  regardless of remaining health most of the time you will be surrounded by crowds of foes fighting you at once  which means you often can t focus on killing a single enemy at a time  instead  you will have to react to whoever is the most immediate threat and get them away from you just long enough to deal with the next one  good situational awareness over your opponents and thinking on your feet are a crucial skills to pick up in addition to combos that deal plain damage  some moves have specific utility purposes  palm strikes can push an enemy away from you to create some space  leg sweeps knock them onto the ground and disarm them  with throws you can knock someone into a nearby wall for additional damage  or into a crowd to stagger many foes at once  brute force alone usually isn t enough to do well  but utilizing the environment and choosing the right moves will help tremendously occasionally you will get the chance to pick up weapons like wooden bats or staffs  letting you deal more damage and extending your reach  they are very potent against weaker enemies  who will go down in far fewer strikes  weapons have limited durability and won t last forever  so you can t rely on them at all times  but in certain troublesome encounters the extra edge can make or break a fight  throwing your weapon can also stun and massively hurt whoever is unlucky enough to be in the way combining all the various aspects of combat and using them effectively isn t going to come naturally right away  you may start out just circling around groups  trying to play it safe while fishing for lucky hits with some stray punches  the game encourages you to replay stages a lot  becoming gradually bolder and more secure with your grasp on the mechanics until they become firmly embedded as instinct  this is the point where you will begin making many split second decisions resulting in impressive looking strings of moves  that knock enemies all over the place and leave nobody in the room with any chance to catch their breath  h1 difficulty  h1 upon death  the game allows you to resurrect right on the spot and carry on fighting immediately  this comes at the cost of your character s age increasing each time you continue  growing too old means you lose for good and have to restart the level  after beating a level  your current age is saved as a starting point for the next one  so when you die of old age  you only lose progress of the current stage  you can go back to previous ones and try to beat them with fewer deaths  to give you more room for mistakes in the late game  which is very much encouraged after struggling to finish the early levels without wasting too many years  it might seem like a monumental task to ever be beating the whole game  let alone replaying it for the true ending  however  you ll find that repeated runs of a level will go by much faster and smoother as your experience grows  lost health is easily regained with takedowns  and improving at reading and responding to enemies will allow you to do them faster and more reliably consistently playing very badly will eventually force you to start over and try to do better  with overall decently skillful play however  the occasional misstep will not become a serious obstacle  the game is much more forgiving than it makes itself seem  it asks not for perfection  but you do have to grow alongside the game s increasingly demanding challenges bosses are less forgiving  and likely where you will burn most of your deaths on  they tend to react better to some of your  dirty  moves and generally aren t as easily overwhelmed as regular enemies  the emphasis lies more on learning the precise patterns on when to block and evade them  it s a very different pace from the rest of the game and feels a lot more rigid in how you overcome them  luckily  being able to resurrect means you are less likely to be stuck with retrying a boss forever  unless you want to go for minimum deaths  h1 technical issues  h1 motion blur and temporal antialiasing cannot be disabled easily in game  it is necessary to edit  engine ini  in   localappdata  sifu saved config windowsclient  and add these lines at the end  systemsettings r motionblurquality 0r postprocessaaquality 0i would also recommend installing the game on an ssd if possible  the game loads chunks of the level during gameplay when you pass certain load triggers  this causes a noticeable stutter  which is made worse by being installed on a hard drive  installing it on an ssd doesn t make it fully go away  but it makes it much more bearable  i m not sure why proper asynchronous loading wasn t implemented  since consistent stutters in the same areas are quite annoying when replaying levels over and over again  thankfully most of the time they don t interfere with combat  the game runs fine and without hitches during regular gameplay  h1 final judgement  h1 this is easily my favorite game that i discovered this year  it captures the vibe of a gritty  chaotic martial arts movie  not only with its combat  but also with the attention to detail  little unpredictable moments like enemies accidentally hitting each other in a crowded hallway or furniture breaking apart into improvised weapons go a long way to make fights feel immersive  the animations for everything are incredibly smooth and incorporate the nearby environment very seamlessly  such as unique takedown animations for slamming someone s face into a kitchen table  should you find yourself next to one everything about this game is executed masterfully and it all comes together to an incredibly satisfying experience  that is going to stick with me for a while sifu is worth full

scenery to create an immersive environment   and lastly  an immaculate audio selection that accompanies the journey  with excellent sound effects and a song for every situation that captures the moment astoundingly well   td   td   despite how fun the boss fights are  they peak in challenge very early into the game  and the title becomes substantially easier until the end   td   tr   table  h1 story  h1 the once prosperous lands of cvstodia have fallen from on high at the hands of a foul curse that has come to be known as the miracle you take control of the penitent one as he awakens from the dead to bear witness to the massacre of his brothers and sisters for opposing the church he once served  with the sacred blade mea culpa  he must travel across this tainted world  purging it of its corruption and bringing penance to now dying lands that embody it i genuinely adored the story written here  a tragic tale that cradles you from the moment you start the journey to the moment it ends  delivering you an account of betrayal and vengeance  and as the screen goes dark for the last time  you are left to contemplate if the fight was worth the victory  h1 gameplay analysis  h1  h3 requiem aeternam  h3 you will spend most of your time in blasphemous fighting against the people and creatures that call cvstodia home  so it is best to become acquainted with the mechanics of how to do so effectively as quickly as possible   you have very few means of self defence early into the game  so you will become familiar with dodging  parrying and counter striking at opportune moments  firstly  evading is the most straightforward and useful tool because completely removing yourself from the path of danger is the safest method to keep living  the alternate approach that is far more critically timed is the parry mechanic  where you remain at risk to perfectly time a block  stun the enemy and allow a window for you to counterstrike   you will slowly build an array of magical abilities as you discover them in hidden and secret places that can be useful in giving you an edge in combat  they vary from buffs to more versatile damage spells   lastly  and probably the most important tool on your belt  is the sword you have in your hand  the mea culpa is a sacred blade that starts pretty weak despite how it looks but will gradually get stronger until it becomes as feared as it should be  you upgrade its versatility at shrines located across cvstodia and by spending tears of atonement  which serves as the currency in blasphemous   boss encounters will be your greatest challenge in testing your growing abilities  as they vary from relatively simple in both method and style to far more complex and challenging  my one major bugbear lies here as there is a rather steep difficulty curve early on  but once past that  the rest of the game becomes spectacularly easy https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3014195123 h3 detestatio sacrorum  h3   the remainder of the experience will entail you exploring the world  and there is a literal plethora of secrets across the game to locate  varying from collectibles to story related key items and lore related entries  to name a few   these items can help you unlock some seriously invaluable powers which will greatly assist you on your travels  and for the truly vigilant  it can deliver you a new ending   thankfully throughout your journey you will have access to an ever updating map that provides a lot of helpful information you can utilise to traverse the world and locate those pesky hidden items you may have missed  the map also marks specific places of interest and allows you to add your own custom markers as points of reference https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id

retro style in both how it looks and plays  but at the same breath  the beautifully drawn backgrounds are astounding to take in  it is also extremely graphic despite its style  and i would not recommend anyone drastically underage to play this title as many of the themes are extremely adult in nature https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3014195305the audio is much the same

in early access but i had to get this written because i m absolutely in love with this game  both for its gameplay as well as its narrative  again  this game is in early access but they ve completed the main scenario and have what they consider to be the full roster of playable characters  they intend to add another ending and make small changes fixes at the time of this writing but i would consider the game whole and reviewable  i ve omitted a few things from the review so you can have the same joy of discovery i did lets start with the gameplay  you play a young girl named lucy who does not directly fight in the combat encounters but instead provides support skills and relies on a party of up to four  investigators  to do the fighting for her  when you begin a run you will get to pick any two investigators to come with you from all those you have unlocked  they are divided up into the holy trinity of attacker defender supporter for ease of sorting  each investigator comes with their own fixed deck and card pool to draft from  as well as a unique passive ability  and because there are 20 investigators the potential to find combos is insane  i ll leave the joy of discovering these to you  once you ve chosen your two investigators you will start on a six map campaign across four unique biomes the maps are proceduraly generated and you can move about them with wasd  or click to move  on the maps you can find all the things you d expect   shop    event    treasure    battle   and  boss   lets start with the easy ones  shop  lets you purchase items ranging from  artifacts   permanent buffs   to  consumables   and  equipment   it also lets you  identify  items  some items have enchantments you d need to equip or identify to see   event  will give you a choice of two events  you pick one but don t have to encounter it right away or at all if you don t want to   treasure  will either be a locked or unlocked box with something good in it  to open a locked box you need a key  those same keys can be used in many events to get a favorable outcome  where you use your keys is a hard and meaningful choice  one last note before i try to tackle fighting  because you can move about the map and choose what to encounter when there is a layer of strategy to choosing the order you do things  there are even hidden paths on the map once you really get into it  battle  is  a normal encounter with enemies unique to each biome  combat in this game does not follow the same formula as most in the genre  you will draw a starting hand from the collected pile of your investigator s and lucy s deck and that hand is persistent  no discarding and redrawing a full hand each turn here  the terror of having an empty hand and picking up a useless card on your turn is something most digital deckbuilders omit but i find this game to be stronger for it  luckily you re given two great tools to get around this  once per turn you can discard one card and draw another  before fighting  you can choose one card in each investigators deck to set as a  fixed ability  you won t draw that card but will have access to it at an increased cost every turn  this system alone lets several builds per investigator really shine  the charon who sets  soul stigma  and the one who sets  scatter darkness  are essentially two totally different characters and you d build their decks accordingly each enemy will tell you when it will act but not what it will do  when you play a card its cost will be blue or purple  blue cards are  swift  and do not cause time to pass  purple cards when played cause time to pass and the cost of all that investigator s purple cards to increase in cost by 1 for that turn  this means that often you will play a card or two  the enemy will hit you  then you will continue playing cards  when you take a hit instead of losing health  the targeted investigator will have that portion of their hp converted to  healing gauge   that can be healed by your cards or healed automatically at battle end  if they take another hit that portion of  healing gauge  will become semi permanent damage  timing your heals becomes important quickly  if victorious you ll be rewarded with items and level up currency that you then have to assign to your investigators or to lucy herself  this allows you to build around favorite investigators in your party to skew your draw pile towards their deck or to level up lucy for more energy and card draw skills  boss  tiles steal the show  not only are there multiple possible bosses per map  they all get their own music and have thematic mechanics  these are masterpieces and setting the difficulty to  expert  adds even more mechanics on top  they re pretty much all well telegraphed using status markers  after you beat a boss you can continue to a campsite or continue to explore your current map  at the campsite you can heal up  give gifts to investigators to raise their affection towards lucy  upgrade cards  smith equipment  recruit a new investigator from a small pool  and set artifacts  as for the story  it is hard for me to talk about the narrative itself without giving away some fun moments but i will say that this game has a story and while it has some lengthy visual novel style scenes it also expresses itself well in the gameplay  you will know by the end why the cultists wear those masks  who everyone in battle represents  and also with excellent themed runs  things like  these two go out alone   this happened elsewhen  and a final run that has a unique set of bosses that had a great blend of narratively relevant mechanics  this is all tied together with really good music and unlike a lot of these games with a great but shallow tracklist this one goes deep  pretty much every boss outside of the first map gets its own theme  they ve even gone and added some special effects to certain big cards and made an attempt at midbattle cinematics  a lot of effort to put in and it shows  chrono ark is unafraid to have an explicit narrative and further unafraid to lock it behind some challenging combat  this was fine for someone like me who is several hundred hours into the genre but the game can be unforgiving and the difficulty options include  standard    expert   and four levels of  blood mist  which adds some new systems as you progress through the maps  if you want the challenge decreased you can set it to  hope  mode which is not a difficulty setting so much as a way of changing what you keep on loss  there is a saving grace though  and its the steam workshop support this game has  there are a ton of qol features and difficulty adjustments up on the workshop alongside a plethora of extra investigators i do have some minor gripes  the translation is good but is full of small grammar and spelling errors  having lived through the days of playing games with a j  e dictionary in one hand and a controller in the other  i don t mind one bit  the hub area between runs is big  slow  and largely empty  its strangely devoid of the fun secrets you can find during a run and your scattered investigators dialogue never updates in this area  unlocking investigators is pretty easy to do with the requirements spelled out on character select  except for the twins helia and selena which could use some clarity  i usually want to write a review soon after 100 ing a game but i m so positive on this one i had to give it a few weeks to make sure i still thought it was so good  it is  i don t know why more people are not talking about this one but so long as they are not i d consider this a hidden gem",2023-12-01,2023-12-01,True,32,0,0.763469696044921875,0,False,False,True

keep adding the same object for decoration and leveling up each room  maybe the dlcs offer more objects  but the base game alone isn t very exciting  if you want an easy management game  two point

 mandatory grinding is minimal  skip smithing mining  it s worthless   the game is extremely different than most ff tactics style games but overall it s best in class  there are many things i wish i knew at the start     b for your first playthrough  i strongly recommend easy difficulty  b   several late game bosses and even some tournament fights are wildly difficult on early playthroughs     b for starting traits  i recommend anything which increases your action speed and effective learner    b  effective learner doubles the effectiveness of weapons skills learned from martial arts manuals and is the best in the game     b starting weapons  i recommend blades or swords on your first playthrough  b   with either blades or swords  your most important attribute to focus on will be dexterity    mid game you ll have an option to join a sect and a faction  sects are the most reliable way to find the most important powerup in the game  great weapon abilities  if you re on blades  you can also gain powerful abilities by convincing the butcher to join your party or defeating your rival fu several times  if you re on swords  lainya sword pavilion is probably the strongest sect for you but more grindy than most   like  do you actually want to become a master miner and a grandmaster blacksmith  these are semi required in their quest line      i think reaching the end of the main emperor plotline requires joining a faction  i ve only been able to join the yi family battalion faction and don t know if the others are open to players at this point  if the main plot has stalled out and you haven t been asked to rescue the emperor yet  try interacting with the members of your faction and completing any assignments they give you   after you ve unlocked the horse from the starting village and have accumulated around  1000 1500  your first big decision in the game is which of the three cities to visit first   each interstate trip is very expensive early game so it s a meaningful decision    b the best early option is the eastern city  linan  b   you can earn  10 000 every 5 days in the eastern city by winning the underground arena  to unlock the ua  talk to everybody in the eastern city s hotel and then talk with the performing artist in the eastern city s market  daytime only   he will give you the password to get through the underground arena s guard    there s some randomness in which enemies you draw in underground arena  on rounds 4 and 5  you can draw a really easy win  like a level 20 30 human enemy or a high level animal  or an impossibly difficult level 50 60 human enemy like the butcher or the sinister old woman  it s okay if you re only winning runner up at the start  that still pays  5000  or you can reload a save for another chance at  10 000    most fights do not pay money  you can earn  1000 each day by training apprentices at any city s dojo where you have sparred with the dojo master on the highest setting  this is usually achievable by level 20 or 30     passive  abilities are extremely important  if you re not sure what to focus on  the wind school s fearless charge and windwalker add a tremendous amount of damage and mobility  the earth school s armor build up adds a lot of survivability in drawn out battles  and the yin school s deadly strike is useful if you re inflicting status ailments   b i generally give wind school an s tier and earth an a tier   b     b all of the extremely difficult fights in the game are one on one  b   i do not recommend passive abilities geared towards groups of enemies    the english translated riddles won t make any sense unless you speak chinese  check steam s guide if you need the answers  i recommend skipping riddles unless you re joining the confucius sect    weapon skills are mainly improved by equipping and mastering kung fu manuals   b just using your sword a bunch won t improve your sword stat   b   your starting traits and a few consumables also help     in most games  becoming a grandmaster blacksmith is the best way to get the best weapons   b but it s usually worthless in this game  b   in this game  almost all equipment is garbage  and the few pieces that are notably better than using your starting weapon are obtained via quests and exploration  unless you re a member of the lainya sword pavilion  i don t recommend getting into smithing at all    there s nobody in the starter village that buys weapons   so smithing is even more worthless than normal early on    i don t know if they ve implemented craft armor yet  i ve played for 100  hours and haven t seen any armor recipes    b non combat skills do not matter  b   the only ones which are actually semi helpful are explore and machinery  mid game you can train machinery  the lockpicking skill  with the head of the tomb raiders sect and one of the named characters at the water camp even if you haven t joined these groups   if you ve joined the confucius sect  the guy with the wheelchair at your sect is also an option     it s a bit grindy  but you can leave your one sect and join another  though i don t think this is required for any endings or achievements     in the southern city  there is a hero statue  if you bow to it 10 times  previously 100 in earlier builds   you receive a kickass sword  after you get the sword  the statue starts giving outrageous amounts of luck experience and it ll take another 10 minutes   125 bows  to get your luck stat from 1 to 10    if you re under 10 in an attribute  you can boost it with practice  strength grows over time with mining chopping gathering  luck if you use the statue  and dexterity if you run around  intelligence and constitution don t have any practical options at present   b except for luck  i do not recommend spending time grinding up stats  stats which aren t tied to your main weapon aren t usually particularly helpful  b     late game  you ll be introduced to something called the  peak of challenge   this isn t part of the main quest and is mainly a show of supremacy  so don t be discouraged if you try it and get instantly smoked  the game actually intends you to go through the emperor s storyline  unlocked through your faction    back attacks only trigger if you are in the one tile immediately behind an enemy  side attacks only appear to trigger immediately beside the enemy  overall  back and side attacks help but less than in most games  if you have to choose between a back attack   30  damage and increased critical rates  and running around the world to wreck someone with fearless charge  fc is usually way better  using windwalker  you can engineer turns so that you get both the back attack and a huge charge bonus   b this is the way   b    a  shichen  is 2 hours

really cool in chinese   is an open world wuxia rpg life sim where you pretty much do what you d expect  you cultivate your little man in various ways  challenging and overcoming other xia in the wulin while you journey through the jianghu  and eventually conquer the world and marry a dozen or more pixelated babes  or maybe you just fuck off and become the world s foremost scholar of confucian thought  or you marry into a northern barbarian dynasty  or something else entirely  overall  it s pretty god damn good  it is also the kind of game that will destroy certain people s lives irrevocably while this game has enough going on that eludes easy description  once you boot it up and try to create a character it becomes clear that rpg is as all can see  you allocate points to five base physical attributes like strength or dexterity  you pick a weapon type to specialize in  and then throw in some innate traits perquisites like running faster or scoring more critical hits  and away you go  combat is grid based srpg fare  with bonuses to damage for side and back attacks and various debuffs and ultimate moves spicing things up  there are dozens of questlines and recruitable npcs  often linked to one another  a very common formula is to meet someone  give them a few gifts to overcome an initial disposition hurdle  then receive a quest which concludes with them joining your party  and maybe a dozen or so factions you can join  depending on how narrowly you want to define that term  time marches relentlessly and some world events that fall nearest to what you d call a  main quest  happen with or without your involvement  though overall the game is pretty soft on stuff like that  almost always giving you an obvious popup telling you where to go if you want a piece of that action developing your character   what we in this  the chinese century  call cultivation   is where the game starts to get a little bit psycho for my tastes  in addition to the turn based rpg combat fundamentals  your character also develops through a variety of life sim components which can only be described as grinding  you mine mineral nodes for ores  chop trees for wood  fish  and stick your arm to the hilt into giant anthills looking for exotic insects to consume to increase your knowledge of toxins mithridatically  all of these activities are governed by skills which level from 1 to 6 at a glacial pace  consuming a stamina bar all the while which must be restored by resting or consuming food  while doing all these things  you are also gaining infinitesimal quantities of xp which go toward increasing your base stats  praying at a shrine makes you smarter  and you can use epic  or legendary tier incense to gain vastly more  natch  and mining makes you stronger  that sort of thing  at points when i really got lost in this shit it honestly felt more like i was playing elona than any kind of a martial arts simulator  there s an argument to be made as to whether or not you really need any of that crap  of course  but at minimum i would say you need to at least reach the soft cap in all the basic physical attributes and learn to craft yourself one of the highest rarity weapons in order to overcome the endgame bosses  or at least i certainly did here s the twist  though  and this is what enables me to recommend the game rather than simply writing it off as a tedium simulator  it s chinese  at the end of the day  so what you re really supposed to do is metagame or outright cheat  while you may only get 20 xp for forging a basic  green tier  glove or sword  and it takes 6 000 to max out your crafting skill  you can forge legendaries for 500 xp a pop  how do you reach the point where you can even forge legendaries to begin with without grinding  that s right  you bribe someone stronger or wealthier than you and ask them to give you a leg up  many npcs can teach you the fundamentals of a skill in exchange for small favors  100 xp a pop  but as you explore more and become more famous you ll find people who can give you as much as 3 600 xp in a single session  more than enough to get you over the hump and subsequently speed up the remaining progress to the point where it s no obstacle at all  rather than simply being a fidget spinner to assuage our collective ocd  the game instead blossoms into a complex metagame of grind optimization that reveals to you the underlying secret of the chinese cosmos  hard work is for suckers  and cheaters always win the game s free form sandbox gameplay and branching faction questlines deserve special mention  this is very clearly a labor of love  and very often you ll be rewarded for a clever idea with a pat on the head from the developers  the game opens with your hitherto unknown mc stumbling upon two women on the woods  both severely wounded and locked in a mortal struggle  each asking you to intercede on their behalf  the basic tutorial choice you re offered is to help one and capture the other  subsequently ingratiating you to their respective factions and giving you a foot in the door to the martial world  but what if you decide to go psycho mode and just murder them both while they re vulnerable  well  that gives you a special achievement and permanently brands you as a member of the he man woman hater s club  can you instead just walk away and ignore them  of course  and later on you ll meet a traveling swordsman who gives you a quest to join the blacksmithing pavilion instead  if you take too long to make your choice  reinforcements show up to assist the bandit girl and kill you as a witness  if you manage to powergame so effectively  and  likely  set the game on the easiest difficulty  that you beat this ambush  you will immediately trigger a game ending whereby your character reveals that he is a forgotten martial arts master who was merely pretending to be a noob for fun  unlocking a new chievo and sending you back to the main menu  obviously they front load a lot of these ideas  but even very late in the game i was stumbling upon novel and rewarding stuff  there must be well over a dozen endings  not counting minor ones which don t truly end the game  and the triggers to unlock some of them are obscure while never being infuriating like  true routes  in these kinds of games can be my first playthrough took me just under 60 hours  and when i got the ending i was happy with i hadn t even really finished what could most accurately be called the  main quest  of the game  preferring instead to just wrap up things with my own faction and rest on my laurels in anticipation of a new playthrough on the highest difficulty in a few months when they drop the next content expansion  oh yeah  i forgot to mention  this game is also a  roguelike    2023 definition  so each of these little achievements in a given playthrough unlocks new traits and raises your stat limits in subsequent runs  letting you grind to heights previously thought unreachable through even more blatant cheating  i really recommend this game to anybody who likes  well  exactly this sort of

originally written in chinese  and currently has a community translation officially implemented and accessible from the main menu  however  while the translation is passable  there are definite oddities  such as the in game riddles making no sense  and various grammar issues  your martial arts start at  the oneth level  for example  and characters occasionally talking in third person   the 1 0 release may fix this with a better translation  but that remains to be seen if you re unfamiliar with wuxia  then it s very heavily martial arts themed  a big part of progression is obtaining new  more powerful martial arts  each martial art has different stats and effects  which you can combine with the traditional levelling system  level 1 to 100   the typical rpg reminiscent stats system  constitution  luck  strength  intelligence   and equipment of various tiers and effects to make your character more powerful while the stats system looks fairly generic and traditional  there are some differences from what you d expect  i d recommend carefully reading the tool tips  as i was rather surprised that for some reason your damage and defence stats are heavily influenced by your intelligence stat  where in other rpgs  typically those would fall under something like strength and or constitution the game is  open world  in the sense that  as long as you have talked to the correct npcs to unlock the areas   some of which have specific requirements   you can freely travel to and from those areas via an over world travel map  accessed by talking to  coachmen   who allow you to ride a horse and carriage  this does mean that on subsequent playthroughs  you do need some knowledge of who to talk to and where they are to open up the world  in a manner that reminds me heavily of skyrim  simply wandering around will be enough for you to encounter things  which combined with the progression system  makes this game incredibly addictive  there always seems to be something to do  a martial art to obtain or level up  equipment to get and people to talk to now  the game is designed with multiple playthroughs in mind  your first run is going to be the hardest  but as you unlock achievements you ll be able to get more traits that ll help make your next playthroughs much easier  for example  there s a trait that allows you to skip the levelling grind entirely  and a trait that amplifies the effects of your martial arts stats on your character the game has many different endings  and on encountering those endings you are offered the opportunity to either end your run at that ending  or to continue your adventures  there are  bad ends   no  not that kind  where if you fail certain quests  take certain options or die in battle  your run will end and you ll be forced to reload the game has a lot of content  i ve played for fifty hours and completed two playthroughs so far  and i m not even half way done with everything yet the game isn t perfect though  and there s plenty to criticise  while the game has an npc  lewd old man  that you encounter very early on which gives you op abilities and items and helps guide you through the game  the game doesn t always make it clear where to go or what to do next  this can sometimes be partially because of the translation  but sometimes the instructions are so vague you ll be scratching your head  the journal often isn t helpful either  and you ll find yourself either stumbling around hoping to find it  or looking up a guide while you have a lot of options in terms of progressing your character  the only character customisation is the ability to name the character  and an automatic sprite change when reaching certain points in factions  you cannot change your character s appearance beyond that  with how open and free the game otherwise is  i feel it s something that really detracts from the experience as far as i ve experienced  there s very few ambient sound effects  there s no footstep sounds  no sound of wind or rain  no birds chirping  if you have the music off  it s eerily silent most of the time  except for when very certain things happen   entering and participating combat  or some cut scene dialog sequences if you decide to kill both of the npcs at the very start of the game  you end up getting the  woman hater  trait and allows you to deal extra damage to women in the game  i just wanted to do an villain playthrough  i didn t really intend to have some sort of weird vendetta against women  game some weapons and types of martial arts can feel lacking  for example  there s very few dagger specific martial arts i ve found  and i ve yet to find a bare handed weapon glove beyond the starting one it can be very easy to miss things  and even lock yourself out of certain paths  factions  or endings  this is a double edged sword of how open and how much freedom the game gives you  you can slaughter nearly anyone you come across  or steal  or betray factions  the game won t stop you  for people like me  this ll be a great thing  but for others i can see being able to screw yourself out of things being very frustrating so  overall  do i recommend it  absolutely  if what i ve laid out above at all interests you  buy this game  i personally love it  i can t get enough  and will probably play a lot more of it both before and after the v1 0

scared of losing my nine thousand dollar investment   cow immediately plows through like 4 bandits  tearing off a leg and an arm and leaving a massive pool of blood  other guys fight off bandits as cow absolutely destroys the bandits trying to escape  cow is insane  travel with band of mercenaries and nomads until we reach some town  pack of wolves attacks and breaks one of my guys legs  guards come from town  a few die to the wolves  try to take opportunity to get some sweet guard armor  immediately get caught because guy i tried to loot was bleeding out not dead  guards attack stealing guy

slavers pull up  battle goes on for about thirty irl minutes as i m pausing and trying to figure out how i can win  barely survive with beaten and dying men and dying robot  one survives  heals others  goes to heal robot  realizes he doesnt have a repair kit  repair kits cost like 5000 dollars  do not have that kind of cash  around 1000   realize what i must do  frantically mine copper with all three of my guys as soon as they recover while the dog guards the dying robot  make barely enough  buy repair kit  sprint to repair robot  robot is seriously dying  finally get there and start repairing  the damage is too great  robot dies in the arms of my family of misfits  jaw drops to the floorall of this happened in about 13 hours of gameplay  with no story  no quests  just me playing  with my own goals  in a massive world  meeting random characters  i should say that this game is an amalgam of things i dislike  i don t like slower stat based rpgs  i don t like real time strategy  i don t like survival games  and i find apocalypse games such as fallout to have extremely drab and ugly environments  yet despite being all these things and more rolled into a giant meat taco  kenshi has me utterly captivated in its gameplay  everything happens in a fairly non scripted open world sandbox environment where a lot of the fun is simply experiencing and living in the world  no game has ever had me so connected to my character  and ironically  there is no given story to your character  as the only way for your character to improve in something is to experience it for themselves  want to get better at fighting  go fight then  want to get tougher  get beat up more and survive  want to do anything  keep failing until you get it right  whatever doesn t kill you will make you stronger and that is how you progress in this game  the high difficulty comes not from the actual enemies in the world  though they are quite tough  but instead knowing what fights you can and cannot take  all of those stat points mean nothing if your character is dead in the wasteland  and this raw feeling of survival gives you such a will to live and a want to grow to be the strongest  no other game has ever come as close to the feeling of intensity for me as kenshi has  steam says i ve only played about 13 hours of this game so far but those 13 hours were so special i felt the uncontrollable urge to post a review  while reading the reviews for this game i was highly skeptical of the freedom it claimed to have as i am used to having controlled freedom such as in a bethesda or rockstar open world game  in games like that there is a huge  lush open world to explore but the story or side quests are only happening in one little dot on the map  this is not that  this is a true open world experience with unbridled freedom where you make your own story  interactions and personal experiences  not that there is no dialogue  there is some written for interactions in towns that are often deadbeat ironic statements that i find extremely hilarious  and depending on the race gender of characters in your party they have special things to say to each other about places they visit and things they do in passing that can be an informative or comedic reprieve from the desolate and violent wasteland that surrounds them  despite the world of kenshi being very run down and barren from an outside view  the game still feels full of life and action  even though all that surrounds you is an ancient  utterly destroyed world  while i dislike drab environments with little in them where simply walking around makes me want to throw up  kenshis world is so captivating and deeply atmospheric that i ve actually come to like the visuals for the most part  about 99  of the music is also amazing  there is one track  or maybe its some sort of sound effect  that i find incredibly irritating and loud  but other than that outlier  the simple  haunting melodies which sound like exploring a ghost town perfectly match the atmosphere of wandering and surviving a wasteland alien world  i ve only spent a few hours in the world of kenshi so far  but its left more of an impression on me than most games i ve put a hundred hours into have  i look forward to exploring more of this world in its vastness  until then  see you space cowboy edit  i ve played 30 more hours since this review  my opinion has not changed on this game overall  but there is so much more i could say as i ve gotten into it  i would buy this game again on a different account just to review it againedit 2  i m closing in on 300 hours as of right now  i ve had many playthroughs  i ve died  lost limbs  starved  been enslaved  but i ve also been rich  been a master smith  destroyed empires  raided towns  waged

language based puzzle game loosely based on the biblical myth of the tower of babel  with the game s narrative taking place in a structure similar to etemenanki throughout the game  you will have the chance to travel through five levels of the tower  each inhibited by a different nation with an entirely distinct linguistic system and culture using only non verbal information presented to you in the beginning  your task is to translate and understand each one  and in the end  break the long lasting language barriers by connecting each nation together this title is one of the brightest releases of the year  offering plenty of challenges even to the most skilled puzzle player while also presenting a deep and philosophical narrative paired with phenomenal art and music direction  b pros  b   phenomenal puzzle design with an adequately good learning curve  a minimalist graphical style  paired with beautiful musical score  a surprisingly engaging narrative with a multitude of philosophical questions b cons  b   the stealth sections felt somewhat unnecessary h1 in depth review  h1 you ll encounter your first puzzle just a few minutes into the game  and it s so easy it shouldn t even be called a puzzle  in your path is a door with a lever on the right side  to unlock the door  simply turn the lever  if not  it will have to close  the up and down positions of the lever  however  both have labels  so it s not hard to figure out which one represents  open  and which one represents  close  this basic premise is exploited extensively in a wide variety of ways throughout  i chants of sennaar  i   naturally  most puzzles will be significantly more challenging than this  but the fundamental mechanics will remain constant what i find most intriguing about this title is how much of it depends on the player s that is  the person in front of the screen s knowledge the game provides a way to check if your translation is correct  but it is not necessary to use it to complete the game  this one feature alone made the game much more enjoyable for me  i ve never previously felt so accomplished and satisfied when playing a puzzle game  both the variety and the difficulty of the puzzles vary greatly throughout the levels   some will require a little bit of backtracking  others will incorporate the language from a previous level  and in some instances  you will face a stealth scenario  which for me felt completely unnecessary and threw me a little off guard  don t get me wrong   it isn  t hard at all  but it doesn t fit well into the game each level connects to at least two others  allowing you to easily backtrack whenever you like  if you re a completist  you ll have to put in some time wandering around to unlock all the achievements  but doing so is simple and won t cause you any trouble naturally  up until this point  my main focus was on describing the puzzle mechanics that are the heart of the game   however  it is worth noting that the game has a narrative that isn t afraid to delve into some philosophical topics  learning about the history of the world and the structure that surrounds you is part of the fun  so i don t want to take away from your enjoyment however  it is safe to say that the game s message  which is something that s been said numerous times  is best summarized by  i rita mae brown  i    language is the road map of a culture  it tells you where its people come from and where they are going  on a final note  i feel like both the art and the music direction deserve praising  making each level unique isn t only about constructing different languages but also about showcasing each nation s distinct culture  the game generally uses stylized graphics with very vibrant hues  however  each level uses fundamentally different colors  which represent its inhabitants  the music is also very effective in creating an immersive experience  achieved by using different variations of a general melody throughout the game  h2 conclusion  h2 as much as i want to stay analytical and explore both the positive and negative sides of this game  i simply can t find any hiccups or elements that heavily impacted my enjoyment   it is safe to say that  i chants of sennaar  i  is a strong contender for the indie game of the year award  nonetheless the puzzle game of the year award  b final rating  b

lover s time  but i have a lot of criticisms  too i am the poster child of this game s target audience   i was a jrpg lover of the 90 s and consider chrono trigger to be nearly unmatched masterpiece that it generally lauded to be   i played and loved super mario rpg  where the timed hits took inspiration from  and the old zeldas and lufia ii  where the puzzles likely drew from    i was a backer on kickstarter  and i thought this was going to be the one   the top dog chrono trigger spiritual successor that i ve waited nearly 30 years for   sea of stars  to that mission  did not deliver i m afraid   i 100  cleared the game  got the true ending  found the easter eggs  completed all mini games etc this game s visuals can only be described as outstanding   i m a pixel art andy  and sea of stars knocks the visuals straight out of the stratosphere   the lighting  the vibrant color palettes  the absolutely absurd number of sprite animations for each of the main cast  for the various traversal means they use in the world  climbing  tight rope walking  swimming  etc    chef s kiss  sea of stars raised the bar here   they set a new standard for how gorgeous a retro inspired rpg can be   while still capturing that retro look and feel the sound was pretty good   it had some bangers  i like  encounter   and the jungle theme as two right off the top of my head    the sound effects were also solid  and the sound more than holds its own   it s not giving me earworms like any trails game would  but i was still generally delighted by what i was hearing regarding gameply  i ll start with the most important part  the combat   it s    honestly just ok   the combat has some problems   first  it s very easy   i mean let s face facts  chrono trigger s a masterpiece  and that game wasn t hard either  but sea of stars just has some really game breaking mechanics  like serai s disorient  or a certain character s ultimate  which drastically delay enemy turns   this stuff was abusable to the point where most mid late game bosses could be killed without getting virtually any turns   still  i don t personally play a game like this for dire challenge  so let s just move on the timed hits  and blocks  were  again  just ok in my opinion   i probably could have done without the   moonerang and sunball felt great   venom flurry had this frustrating problem where often serai would be off screen  so you re trying to time it blindly   not great   blocking felt considerably worse to me  because the animations in the game were a little janky   a lot of attacks came from nowhere  like spikes coming from the ground    blocking horizontal projectiles felt good  but many other attacks it was a matter of if you knew the animation or not  for me  the novelty of the timing wore off  pretty quickly  and by the end of the game  moonerang  my favorite spell   just felt tediously long to execute because i was going to get many bounces   this segues into my next complaint   lack of abilities   barring combos and each character s late ish  game ultimate ability  they were each relegated to 3 abilities   and they start with two   what a travesty   progression is a key cornerstone in rpg s  and unlocking new abilities is a key to that   the game s severe lack of ability variety made mechanic progression feel almost non existent   new combos were ok  but combos aren t usable on demand   same with ultimates  and in both cases  some options grossly outshone the others  i m looking at you  mr  eagle     and it s made even worse by the fact that most characters had wildly underused abilities from their meager lot of 3   moonerang  disorient  and sunball got a lot more play than any other moves   if you re going to give me that small of a lot of abilities  at least don t make it a no brainer which one i m going to use 90  of the time    i felt pretty burnt out of it by the end of the game   and the  trash  mobs in the game just felt too    beefy   they were seldom hard  but i kept wishing i could  falcon hit  my way through trash and be on with my session  rather than being routinely stopped by the harmless punching bags exploration was fantastic   it must be the freest and most interactive traversal i ve ever seen in a retro inspired rpg like this   you can swim in that body of water   you can climb that ledge    or jump off if there s a space below to land on   you really felt like you could touch the world you were exploring  and you were often rewarded with treasures or vistas   or both   for doing so   an retro inspired jrpg had no right to have this good of traversal  but sos went ahead and raised the bar anyway   well done the mini games were ok   the fishing was basic  cute  and lean   100  clearing the game s fishing was pretty much not a chore at all  and the ridiculously overpowered food you could cook from said fish was all the more incentive for me to do it   the  wheels  game was a good deal more tedious bordering on annoying   it was unique and actually really cool looking so i ll applaud that  but i would have skipped it if i could have  more on that later   then there were plenty of puzzles  i honestly found them delightful   none were so complicated as to be frustrating  but they utilized the game s outstanding visuals  and broke up the exploration in just the right way the dual protagonists are extremely bland carbon copies of one another   seriously  their dialogue could be 100  interchange   we have the summer solstice blade dancer and the winter solstice lunar monk   the yin and yang personalities we could have had would have been tropey  but they almost write themselves  but we got 2 self inserts   in a game with  pretty much  5 playable characters  mind you   everyone will tell you garl is the best character in the game  and heart and soul of the party  and i d agree to that   but even then  garl was just a one note happy guy in a room full of drones  and self inserts   he was a good character who shone above all the drab and boring ones he surrounded himself with   none of the characters have a meaningful progression arc  either   the villains were laughably bad and boring storywise  i m a guy who can appreciate a slow burn  but sos was excruciating in this front   trails in the sky  fc  is my favorite jrpg of all time   that game is the uncontested king of the slow burn  but but where sky was different was that it enticed you through witty dialogue  endearing characters  and masterclass world building   sos has none of those things   the dialogue is never good   and for hours you just feel like you re traipsing around a completely inchoerent world   the world building s not there  just a mosaic of beautiful areas that don t plausibly connect to the other  only to be passed through  or explored for some power up artifact needed to progress the plot   sos is completely plot driven   you re the chosen ones   the world needs you   kill the big bad   the first three quarters of the game feels like one elongated fetch quest   game picks a up a bit after that  but it s too little  too late   i never felt invested in the world or any of the characters   by the end  to my utter dismay  the only way you can get the true ending is by 100  completing all the side content   the cardinal sin of rpg s is forcing optional content overall sos is a good game  but it s not a great one   it s carried by its best in class visuals and exploration  but made some big gameplay flaws  and had really bad characters dialogue writing   sure  it tickled my nostalgia  and i did on balance enjoy my time   but i was disappointed   the game has the soul and polish of a masterpiece  but some bad gameplay choices and extremely weak writing hold it back   i give it a 6 10   chained

loaded into the game and that resulted in the first 8 ish hours of content basically being filled with placeholder text  hell  even the long term collectible figure minigame had game code in the dialogue boxes for the tutorial  this has been fixed as of september 1st  but that still means the  i  overwhelming majority   i  of negative reviews complaining about poor writing quality  lack of punctation  etc  are no longer true   edit  i ve gone through the prologue chapters again  while the earlier sections of the game  i  have   i  been touched up  they re still not nearly up to the standard set by the rest of the game  if you re not willing to read through 100 lines of mediocrity under the promise of eating good later on  i d advise against buying  okay  actual review   pretty much everything is excellent  the most commonly praised aspects are the music and overall art  with the environmental designs being easily some of the best in the industry  though the actual maps are fairly linear  the music consistently hits a high bar  to the point that boss fights often took a good minute to actually get started since i d just idle in menu and listen for a bit  additionally  nearly every song in the game has versions for both day and night  as well as a tavern band style doppelganger that you can play at every inn once you find the related sheet music  they spent a ton of effort on the ost alone and it paid off pretty well  and that s ignoring the fact that they got chrono trigger s composer yasunori mitsuda for a chunk of it the combat is probably the weakest part of the game  but not by much  basic combat overview is as follows  everyone has fairly low mana capacity which can be restored with basic attacks  you can lower damage taken increase damage dealt by timing button presses  and doing certain things fills up a meter that s used for tag team combo attacks   a separate meter that s used for ultimate attacks  though that last one takes a while to unlock   there re 2 fairly unique mechanics  locks and raw mana  whenever an enemy starts up a special attack  you have the opportunity to interrupt it by hitting it with enough hits of certain damage types  indicated by the  locks  above the enemy  smaller moves usually have 2 4 locks  while big moves often have 6 or more  even if you can t interrupt the enemy  destroying even a few of the locks will weaken the power of the move  raw mana  meanwhile  is a resource you generate with basic attacks that can be spent to increase damage output for your next attack  in addition to adding magic damage to non magical moves  this can be used for things such as breaking locks  getting around high physical defense enemies without spending mana  or adding a hefty damage bonus  overall the combat is fairly simple while still being engaging due to resource management and the lock system  which organically adds puzzle elements to boss fights  figuring out what moves you need to do in order to make that mage fizzle the nuke they re prepping is satisfying to pull off  and the lock system in general gives you a good reason to use everyone in your party instead of focusing on 2 3 people there are some caveats to the combat  however  with the most common complaint being every character s moveset  everyone gets 3 moves  an ultimate  and at least 1 combo attack with every other member  that s it  the devs ditched the rpg standard of constantly upgrading your moves fire fira firaga style in favor of every character getting a well rounded kit as well as a niche to fill  everyone can  and should  deal damage  all but 1 character can heal  and everyone does everything in different ways  there s no dedicated roles and i personally think the game s better off for it  but i can understand people getting annoyed over the relative lack of options  there s also the slight issue of the lock system  rarely  behaving in strange ways  sometimes i d start a battle and an enemy would have a lock i can t break without a combo attack  which is impossible to do turn 1  there was also a brief portion of the game where i was getting locks for a damage type i didn t even have yet  it was only a few minutes until i got the required character for it  but i hope these things gets fixed finally  we have the story   it s relatively simple  yet still impactful   the kind that anyone can enjoy  but might be left wanting if they re looking for political messages or detail heavy worldbuilding  the main duo are both psuedo self inserts that are fairly normal personality wise and don t really do much to define themselves  the story s set in a way that you see these two from childhood to young adulthood   no dark backstory  no complex motivations  nothing tragic about these two  most of the would be writing for them is instead funneled into their friend who rounds out the starting party  and i have half a mind to think this fucker will go down in history as one of the greatest rpg bro types of all time  dude s awesome  i don t want to say too much about the later party members  but they re all pretty damn good  although one is lacking in terms of character and instead has a cool yet adorable set of animations  the actual overarching plot takes a while to get started  i got to it at around the 6 hour mark  some people got to it at 12   but i d say it s excellent  the main villain s interesting and the game likes to throw around a bunch of neat ideas for regions and artifacts   a mountain that had holes carved in it in order to play a lullaby to lull a destructive dragon to sleep  and a book that magically records the history of detailed objects it touches  to name a couple  there s some particularly creative stuff later on but i won t detail it here the weakest part of the game writing wise   first few areas aside   is definitely the ending   spoiler  the default ending is a slap in the face  and that s putting it lightly  you need to get the true ending in order to get something good  thankfully the conditions are mostly lenient  just do optional bosses and get a bunch of collectibles   but even then there s a decent number of plot threads that seem to be left hanging  at least at first glance  apparently the devs have been running an arg alternate reality game in their discord server since around 2018 and that ties into both this game and the messenger  enabling the community to interact with characters and affect the story of upcoming games  i ve looked into it and it s pretty damn interesting  but there s no indication of this within the game itself and a good chunk of players are going to be missing out    spoiler if you haven t played it already  the demo s a very good indicator of whether you ll enjoy the gameplay  music and map design  the spike in writing quality is  rather inconveniently  only apparent for all the content  i  after   i  the bits that the demo covers  this is a very good title if you can get past

experience one would have when going into what appears to be a retelling of the ancient greek mythology of sisyphus in his quest to atone for his misdeeds against the gods for having both cheated death as well as extreme cruelty towards his guests by means of rolling a boulder up atop the mountain tartarus as part of his divine punishment though unlike the greek tale  where he never did quite make it to the top  due to some form of  enchantment  that i assume would make for an unsatisfying  non ending  of sorts in game form  alongside the landscape not being nearly as hellish  the game of sisyphus allows the player to relive that greek myth by slowly pushing a 20 ton rock boulder through 30 different stages as you progressively get higher up into the hills  mountains and the sky beyond  seeing how  thankfully  unlike the hellish underworld the original tale is based in   each stage is presented in not just a unique setting but also the challenges presented to the player start off gentle enough as is  with the introduction stage simply plopping a bunch of idle obstacles strewn across the first path upwards to teach the player that this is one  mountain  that is going to demand both focus and persistence to succeed in before delving too far into the gameplay and stage design of this game though  the first thing that should be mentioned here is how the controls actually work  seeing how easy it is to get a false impression of the controls if you base the movement entirely on sisyphus himself since simply pushing him against the boulder to move it upwards will only get you so far as mastering the pushing of the boulder requires the use of the mouse buttons to turn the boulder from one side to the other or to prevent it from falling out of your grasp and back down the long trail you worked so hard to climb up speaking further on the  weight  of the controls here as it were  the level design of each stage tests your competency and confidence in this as even the very second level will require you to avoid and maneuver your way across moving obstacles that  despite what some may think  a boulder can not push them asides as this will simply result in you losing control of the big rock as it smoothly brushes it s way past you and making it s way down below  putting the emphasis not so much on taking risks as one might do with the usual  ultra hard  challenging games of jump king and getting over it among others but rather taking your time and using what you have learnt to prevent any setbacks that can be easily avoided with some patience and perception other ways that the later levels test you are  to name a few  level 3 s stone pathway which introduces  explosives  that will send your boulder flying when hit and is a serious threat to progress made that can be lost so easily  level 5 s swamp brings slippery ground into the equation where the boulder can move around more erratically and easier to lose a grip on and level 9 s sandstone throws bumpy and uneven terrain to further add to the complexity of pushing the boulder further uphill  since the game of sisyphus is not what i would personally call a game of  challenge  in my honest personal opinion here rather  as the ancient myth itself highlights  this is a test of one s endurance as there will likely be many hardships of one simple mistake causing the boulder to not just make it s way back down once escaping your grasp but  depending on how lady luck favours you  can either be ease it s speed down to a point that a suitable obstacle not far down will halt it and keep it safe for you to resume  this includes those two stone circular barriers you see at the end of each stage that act as  safeguards  of a sort  or find that simply nothing can stop it s rapid descent down multiple stages or each obstacle simply further guides it down the hill as you rush towards it in the hopes of preventing further lost progress one piece of advice i will give  which some may not consider  is the ability sisyphus has to run and sprint across places  which affects not just his movement in general but also how fast he can push the boulder upwards and sideways  seeing as some places require a slow and methodical approach to carefully moving your boulder across to ensure you keep a firm grip on it  level 13 s ice and level 21 s ash comes to mind  whilst others demand a fast and rapid pacing of both yourself and the giant stone to ensure that neither end up being pushed  blown about or flipped high into the sky by various obstacles that require good timing to dodge   level 7 s pyramid and level 19 s farm are the most demanding about this in particular though with all said and done  where is the  game  part about this that makes the game of sisyphus potentially fun to go back to  seeing how a fun retelling of this historical greek legend  with some liberties taken on account of being a video game  is all well and good  however what is there to compel gamers to come back and give it another shot or two after they do  eventually  reach to the very peak and do what the sisyphus of the mythic tale could not well for those who do accomplish the great feat  you are awarded an amount of gold that varies depending on your overall performance  how long it took  how many times the boulder went  out of bounds  and overall distance travelled alongside the type of  boulder  used  alongside a single coin as acknowledgment of your one victory  in which both the gold and coin s  can be spent on various boulders that were locked at the start of the game to give a second run either a new fancy flair to your boulder or  for the sadistic  to add even further challenge to an already arduous test of one s stoicism in conclusion  i wouldn t exactly recommend this to those who prefer the traditional  challenge games  of sorts  as i believe the developer and publisher behind this game  cream  to have designed this game not for those who fancy speedrunning a game in usual skill based manners  as such games allow those to take massive risks for shortcuts that lend itself nicely to such popular material  rather it is for those who want to achieve something that takes a lot of time and dedication  bizarre as a concept as it may make to base a whole video game on  simply because they believe they can and want to take the challenge head on after all  what is the human spirit if not full of determination and faith tldr version   a unique retelling of the ancient greek myth in video game format that puts the player in the shoes of sisyphus to atone for his punishment by pushing a giant boulder atop the mountain of tarturus      30 unique stages that gradually become more difficult to navigate and push the boulder upwards  testing the player s ability to both move the giant stone with skilled hands and maneuver across dangerous obstacles      the weight of the physics add to the tension that encourages a patient  more careful approach to navigation rather than the usual skill based actions of most challenge games      further replayability is added for those who seek to make the trip once more as gold and coins earned from overall performance and each hike to the top can be used to buy a variety of new  boulders  with different visuals and effects      the slow paced gameplay of the game of sisyphus will likely put off players who are not into games that demand a careful approach with plenty to lose with a mere slip of focus      one stage  rock mountain  is repeated three times with little differences to terrain and gameplay  which simple graphical changes would easily reduce the repetition      the physics would sometimes result in situations where the boulder is in an awkward place that is hard to move it out of alongside not doing much to discourage  wall hugging  until near the end of the game",2024-04-24,2024-04-25,True,8,0,0.571833193302154541,2,True,False,False

game to date  there are also a lot of design choices that really bother me and hold this game back from becoming an all time favorite  i m going to give this game some compliments and then rant for like 8 paragraphs  so buckle in let s start with the positives  as mentioned  the combat in this game is second to none  it is non stop  gorgeous spectacle as you cleave through enemies with unparalleled flow  each character of the impressively large roster of 10 has a completely different style and set of moves  yet each still manages to offer satisfying impact and mobility  the overall production value of the game is also impressive  the art is gorgeous  the sound design is excellent  and fully voiced cutscenes and characters add a big budget feel to the game  it s clear a lot of love and resources were poured into this game  and it s generally the better for it so  the base chassis of the game is excellent  but there are a lot of bothersome aspects i can t help but nitpick  perhaps foremost is the potential system  these are upgrades that offer you entirely new moves during a run  usually activated by a specific button sequence or directional input  it s a great idea on paper   what better way to keep runs fresh by offering completely new movesets each run  right  well  the execution isn t quite there  part of the issue is complexity  each run now demands you keep a mental tally of what moves you have  and  given that there are 10 characters each with a ton of moves  you really never have a chance to get comfortable with your potential loadout in any given run  maybe i m a dummy  and i ll admit that i m not a fan of fighting games for this reason  but there are just too many inputs to remember  look at games like hades and risk of rain 2  you have four core actions  plus an equippable fifth  which is a really good number to offer meaningful choice without overwhelming the player s short term memory  bb ee s potentials also suffer from redundancy  some potentials  like ragna s scythe ability and mai s thousand spears combo  are genuinely great  useful additions to their base moves  however  a lot of the potentials boil down to  this is a combo that deals damage   which is pointless because every character already has a  combo that deals damage  as part of their base kit  it feels bad to get a semi pointless lateral moveset from what should be a vertical upgrade  which makes getting potentials from reward rooms less exciting  these flaws also impact the  normal  upgrade system  called tactics  which is a hades esque system where you slot elemental effects into designated  slots  and build onto them  the tactics are all really cool  and i think these should ve been the focus of character building during a run  but they re sort of eclipsed by potentials  as tracking those takes up most of your mental space  tactics don t have room to breathe because potentials are sucking up all the oxygen the other thing that really bothers me about buildcraft is the legacy system  this is a really interesting idea that lets you carry over two semi randomly chosen tactics  as well as a character unique active ability and passive  over to new runs with different characters  i really like  borrowing  other characters  abilities from this system  i really don t like carrying over tactics  it leads to runs feeling too similar  since you re more likely to head down the same upgrade paths due to using the same legacy tactics over again  it s even worse when you get a really strong legacy tactics pair  because it s too tempting not to take that legacy every run  well crafted roguelites are at their most varied when rng is driving the run in an interesting way  and the legacy system completely nullifies that in bb ee  when the player has to deliberately forgo taking the strong  available option just for the sake of variety  game design has failed along that axis  my final complaint in terms of buildcraft is the game s permanent progression  which is really bad  metaprogression consists of increasing your max hp by  1  and slotting in up to 5 passive abilities  none of which are very interesting  once you ve unlocked your chosen 5  you will never think about this again  compared to metaprogression in other recent titles  like spiritfall  which has a swath of amazing metaprogression systems  bb ee s is really bad and uninspired  it adds nothing to the game other than a bit of verticality in the least interesting way possible  i genuinely think bb ee would be better without this metaprogression  because it adds absolutely nothing in terms of gameplay  only contributing to systems bloat let s move on from character building and onto level design  and i m going to be frank  the level design sucks  rooms are generally just empty boxes you fight in  some may have a few traps  some may have a few platforms  but  by and large  the space you fight enemies in is devoid of any interest whatsoever  the environmental art is gorgeous  but the actual gameplay space is very bland i m also really not a fan of the final biome  the first three biomes use a hades style system where you enter a room  clear it of enemies  choose your next reward  then immediately enter the next room  this keeps the pace moving quickly  which is perfect because the game is so combat oriented  the final biome  however  is a dead cells style open map  it s a somewhat interesting change of pace  but the problem is that it has barely any enemies in it  so the pace of the combat flow suddenly grinds to a halt  you spend a ton of time wandering mostly empty corridors looking for portals  and it feels bad  i know hades mixes up navigation in the final level with the temple of styx  but it still ultimately has you going through a fast sequence of small rooms  which works better for pacing than bb ee s final level does while we re on the topic of pacing  i also have to mention the story  bb ee takes great pains to tell a completely unique  original story in the hub world between runs  and i applaud that  the problem is that it interrupts the main game just too much  hades did the same thing  but its hub was small  and you d really only need to talk to two or three characters at most to hear a handful of sentences of dialogue  bb ee has you watching entire cutscenes  often several back to back  on top of talking to several characters  which are scattered around a comparatively larger hub composed of 3 5 floors  i appreciate the effort in terms of storytelling  but  when all i really want to do is go on another run  zig zagging across the hub and sitting through cutscenes starts to feel like an interruption i wish the game had trimmed down okay  onto my final complaint  i promise  this game is just too easy  i made it to the final boss on my first run  beat him on my second  and have won nearly every run since  i have been pumping up my entropy levels  think heat from hades  every run  but  even at 25 entropy  the game still feels ridiculously easy  roguelites need challenge to remain engaging  and  as fun as cutting through enemies is  it does ultimately get boring when you obliterate both mooks and bosses without much effort  i m guessing the developers wanted to err on the side of ease to keep the game accessible to a larger audience of blazblue fans  who might not necessarily like roguelites  but i do think the game is worse for it after all of this  i do have to give bb ee a thumbs up  because  at its core  its combat and aesthetics are extremely fun and polished  roguelite and action game fans should play this game  they will enjoy it  in a way  though  i think bb ee just suffers from having too much  believe it or not  and would be a better game  at least for me  if it was trimmed a bit",2024-03-24,2024-03-24,True,94,3,0.825012028217315674,0,True,False,False

screen or zoning stockpiles  it likewise also lets the player indulge in some horrific fantasies   like creating a village of cannibals  however  it is different in a few notable ways  unlike rimworld  which quickly breezes through it s early and mid game to reach its late game spacer stage  complete with blaster rifles and stormtrooper esc armor   going medieval narrows it s focus to just the middle ages  this means a player can actually commit to building up a huge castle  and is encouraged to do so   without needing to mod the game so that the enemy ai doesn t consistently break the immersion with their guns and solar panels  it also has actual 3d graphics and models  and lets you build on multiple layers  which is a plus  it s a solid early access game  and you can spend many hours playing it to completion despite it being technically  incomplete   however it is early access  so i have some recommendations  1  research  research isn t that hard once you get the hang of it  but i still struggled a good deal  specifically  nowhere does the game let you know that you have to  unlock  the first research before you can do so for the rest  so you can spend a lot of time getting frustrated that you seemingly can t research agriculture  despite having the books necessary to do so  my suggestion is to include this information in the tutorial  2  wardrobe  like  an actual wardrobe that can hold clothes  for early game  at least  i haven t gotten too far in to the research tree  so there could be a wardrobe item in the late game or something   basically  it makes sense that you can put clay on the ground  food in shelves  and books in book shelves  but  clothes belong on the floor   they decay  and they don t stack either  so you will probably dedicate a whole room in your storehouse for them  3  horses  i like horses  they fit in a medieval colony builder  you can potentially train them to do specific tasks  like pull carts  haul items  or be mounted by a fully armored knight  you can potentially even give them a  clothing slot   for stuff like armor  and it would be accurate to the period  so i genuinely expect them at some point  if nothing else  they re too important to the  aesthetic  of any late game  4  royalty stuff  it s a medieval colony sim  which means that there should be crowns  fancy clothes  throne rooms  and a whole feudal society  at least in the background   let s be honest    probably every player has already mentally assigned a  king queen  for their colony at the start  the ruler  leader  lord lady  etc  that gets to have the best items  best chambers  best food  etc  5  relationships  relationships are important  and have always been important  some similar medieval colony builders  such as banished  for example  can get away without giving details by virtue of being so detached from the minor stuff  there are hundreds of characters by the end game  and none of them have any distinct  individual personalities  but going medieval is more like rimworld  there are a handful of distinct characters  which have individual stats  appearances  backstories  and levels  we already have some form of relationships  in that characters can become friends  but there isn t any romantic anything  which there arguably should be  at least in the final release   even if it s as simple as me  the player  manually instigating a marriage between two characters by  for example  having  cedric  pick some wildflowers and give them to  elise   even if it s just so a  shared room  between them doesn t give as many negative mood modifiers  5  children  going medieval is a harsh world  full of warfare  slaughter  and  at times  cannibalism  which is why the devs decided against adding them  but i would argue in the opposite  children are a big part of a colony builder  you can t have a colony sim that exclusively builds it s numbers through rescuing people after they escape factions or have unfortunate hunting accidents  not one that is sustainable  at least  you likewise can t have any royal families  slowly building a castle from the ground up  lording over the surrounding countryside for generations  if there are no generations to be had  how to implement them is up to the devs  they could add them in the base game or as dlc  they could make them un kill able  with the downside that they can t do much  they could drastically quicken the ageing process for children  only to slow it down as they reach adulthood  they could make it so that  unlike history  every faction and wild animal treats children well  and never targets them for any reason  my biggest concern is for the longevity of a game save  if children are not added  meaning we can not control how our population grows  but our older characters can die of old age  meaning the characters we started out with and took such care in crafting are gone  then there will be no bloodline legacy to keep players invested in some of their longest campaigns  in all likelihood  if they don t add them   children  will likely be one of the most popular things to mod in

overall  the comfy factor is very much there  it feels really cool to ride your little ramshackle choo choo train yoinking resources out of the ether  it s cool to upgrade your stuff and acquire new crafting capabilities  and most of all the game is gosh darn beautiful  seriously  the environmental design is really wonderful and whimsical and cruising through it all on the floating rails is such a pleasant visual maybe give this a try during your refund period if you re unsure  i think it s worth it update  when i got to orange level weapon modules  the gunplay started to feel okay because fire rate and reload speed get a huge step up  too much work for the guns to feel  just okay  to use      i got this because i watched markiplier play the demo long ago  and it looked pretty fun  been waiting on my wishlist until release my 35 hours have been defined by three phases phase i in the first 10 hours  my impressions were that voidtrain was a great  comfy  survival experience in general  new content  namely locations  mechanics and major story beats  are paced spaced out very well also  the first 10 hours see rapid tech tree progression because most of the items only require raw materials phase ii in hours 10 to 20  the player will likely become pretty darn powerful  but some of the cracks also start to show  the requirements for progression grew at a reasonable rate  but producing some of the intermediate components was really starting to get tedious  you have to wait a seemingly arbitrary amount of time for each component you craft at a station  you can get some parallelism going if you have  say  multiple smelters or labs  but the time really adds up combat also starts to show up more and more in this phase  combat  in particular  needs a lot of work 1  it s kind of a nightmare to manage all the weapon modules you receive and understand at a glance which ones provide the best upgrade  they easily fill up your inventory  and then some 2  gunplay feels really loose  sometimes  inputs don t register for seconds at a time for whatever reason  it might be designed to counteract spam clicking  which i inadvertently do sometimes  this gets really confusing because there is a mechanic where guns can jam as their condition worsens  so you can t tell if the game is just ignoring your left clicking or your gun is jammed  small idiosyncrasies like that really detract from harvesting resources  combat and building alike 2 5  guns jam really easily  i feel like jamming should happen around condition 50   not 80 95   but that s just me  all you have to do is press the reload key for your character to fix it 3  enemy ai is either completely ignorant of you or has borderline esp and can hit you from very far away  and there is no in between  i usually just engage at max distance and it solves the problem  but for reasons that would constitute spoilers that s not always an option phase iii at this point i have two really powerful primary weapons  easily thwart any threats or obstacles the game throws at me and have a wealth of nearly every resource  despite all the issues i mention here  the progression does feel really satisfying two of the quests in this phase straight up give you no information about what you re looking for  i spent several levels traveling  not knowing what i was looking for  accumulating a bunch of one particular item and having 0 of another item i needed  and the quest tagline simply says  find a place to x the y   maybe these were obvious to some people  but it s worth mentioning if you want a wealth of resources  specifically  i think combat is one of the most efficient ways to accumulate them  that means a lot of time spent frustrated  feeling like you re trying to fight the game to perform proficient combat and tanking while getting beamed from all angles  hopefully you ve queued up your crafts before you start fighting  so you can at least pass the time fighting instead of staring at the timer on the crafting station i am nowhere near done with the tech tree  as far as i know   but i wonder just how much more of the game there is  i ll update this review if i change my mind about anything by the time i reach the end update  at the time of writing  it turns out i was 5 phases away from completing all the research in the game so far  there are 33 phases now that the research is complete  my train is fully armored and there seems to be no new content left  again  as far as i can tell   i m just going for cosmetic unlocks now when i got to orange level weapon

feel like i ve barely cracked the surface  as it is  i m not even all the way up the tech tree  i don t have all the cool train stuff    but i just keep coming back to voidtrain now  i see some others have called it out in their reviews  and it would be irresponsible for me not to say it as well   this game really isn t what it s trying to sell itself as with its preview videos  when i watch the previews  the image i get in my head is a combat heavy  first person shooter   wave after wave    intense survival type game  like  you re just running all around your train blowing away bad guys while desperately trying to craft a few things so you can have bigger guns to blow away more bad guys  at least  that s what it seems to bill itself as to me  for the folks who are thinking about buying this with that in mind  i d take a look at the rest of this review before buying  this is not to say it s a bad game   it certainly isn t   but i feel like it s trying to make itself look like a mad scramble for survival while blowing through the void at break neck speeds what it really is  is    slow  i ve seen some reviews comparing it to raft  which i haven t played  so i can t comment   but i hear that game is also fairly slow paced  in voidtrain  you start out on a bare bones train   a single platform with one of those  pull it up push it down  engines like you see on the old black   white films  you go down the track  stopping along the way to jump off your train and  swim  around in the void gathering resources  you craft   you research   you build    and then you go down the track some more the combat  as it is  seems to be almost an afterthought    almost like the developers were thinking   we need to spice this up a bit   again  i am not disparaging this game   but i don t exactly feel like i m playing halo here  it can be fun and exciting    but it just feels a little weird  the ai s have no idea what they re doing   they don t know whether they want to gang up on you  take off in a mad retreat  storm you head on  hide behind a rock for protection    or  having achieved that protection  jumping right back out to crack off a few more shots  i find that i m not very good at the combat elements of this game  because sometimes i feel like the natural reaction for a character would be to do this thing  and then they surprise me and do the opposite it s all right  though  it doesn t detract from the gameplay  if the combat is meant to be a  spice it up  bid  it works   it s a bit of an occasional distraction that does add a little salt to the meat   potatoes what this game does amazingly is keeping you in the grind  you re always thinking that that next upgrade is right around the corner  or that you can t wait to build this or that thing  or whatever else is going on  i always find myself gathering as much as i can  because there s always something new to go for    speaking of which  i ve also seen several reviews which are a little down on the inventory system  yeah  the inventories are a little small  haha  of course  you can always craft to increase your own inv  or build chests and the like   but in a world where you build a minecraft chest and store thirteen billion cobblestone  the inventory in this game feels very limited  it still does not  break  it for me  because i m just incentivized to build more chests   but at a certain point  you realize you ve got an entire side of your train filled with them  and you re like   huh   loli feel like this game is great for the market of  boring game players    and some of you will know what i mean   those games that would seem to bore some to tears  such as farming simulator 22  american truck simulator  stuff like that   where the actual gameplay can be somewhat repetitive and a bit of a  mining  grind  you know   mine  so you can make money  so you can get better equipment  so you can mine even more  so you can make even more money  and so on   but for people who like that kind of thing  this one is going to tickle you pink it doesn t have quite the same freedom as  say  space engineers   while the game claims an  open world   it s hard to feel that it s truly open  your building crafting space is limited to the current state of your train  and your train more or less heads in one direction   forward   you can back up a little  but there s a guard that prevents you from serious back tracking   this  doesn t bother me  but it also doesn t really comport with  open world  the graphics are beautiful  i love them  the only sound effects i have issue with are the grappling hook  which makes a kind of a  squish  sound no matter what you grapple    otherwise  the sounds   ambiance are perfect  the world is lovingly detailed and it shows  i love    being in the  void  i m not through the story yet  it s not terribly engaging  i don t mind   i m here for the void and my train  and i don t need the story so it sounds like i ve done a ton of complaining    but i genuinely love this game   just trying to be fair in the review  i feel like some people would hate this game   i feel like some people would grow bored with it   but this is one of those ones where if you re in the right niche  this is going to become a fast favorite for you  it had me hooked very fast ah  the standard  should i pay full price  question  i would  oh  for sure  if you were looking for a fast paced fps  then maybe no    or if you re into fast action games or don t like grinds  then probably no  although again  the grind isn t so steep as to be annoying   if you find yourself loving games of patience and building and working for ever bigger and better  though   yeah  you d pay full price for it  trust me overall  very  very solid game  and  23 9 hours

every graphically decent looking shooter play like the same garbage you have been forcefed since battlefield 69  going commando   h2  well then i ve got a game for you chief    h2  trepang 2 is the long awaited sequel to dopamine and fatherly acceptance  with a combat and movement system so high in testosterone that it turned my sister into being my brother  true story guys i swear   trepang 2 uses old school game design methodology which was once though lost to the ages  only reffered to as  making the game actually fun and polished  revolutionary stuff  chief  h3 the game in a nutshell   h3 you play as a supersoldier only reffered to as 106  the unofficial son between doomguy and john wick  the best way i can describe the style of play is if the movie hardcore henry became a videogame injected with copious amounts of  substances what puts the  b super  b  in supersoldier is your two main abilities  namely invisibility and time slow henceforth reffered to as  focus   on lower difficulties these abilities augment your abillity to feel like a  b god  b  when extracting normies from the mortal coil  on higher difficulties they are the only things standing between you feeling like the master of gaming and getting your skull shot in by a 12g shotgun  besides those  you are also endowed with the strength of a thousand angry swedes  your  melee  attack is doing a flying dropkick into people while going at terminal velocity to forcefully divorce the head from your enemy s shoulders with no custody of the kids  the ragdolls are emmaculate  with you being able to grab anyone from behind or whilst they are knocked down and yeet them at anything within the same postal code as you  grenade strapped to their chest is optional  h3 the weaponry  h3 any good shooter needs weapons that  b feel  b  powerful and are numerous  trepang only has some seven or eight main weapons to choose from but  chief  that is the magical part of it  each weapon is unique with their own mechanics  there is no  true meta  where one handgun does slightly more damage for slightly more recoil that other shooters are plagued by  you wanna shoot a handgun  pick the handgun  want it to go full auto  you can just pick it at the weapons workbench  every gun is customizable to maximize fun  you get to master the weapons with any playstyle you want  all the guns feel and sound satisfying to use  expecially when you  spoiler get the ability to dual wield any weapon in the game  expecially the shotguns and grenade launchers  spoiler  my favorite weapon is the shotgun chief  no weapon has ever felt so good in all my years of gamering  the first time i fired that 12g of pure joy  the sound of the blast echoing off the walls like the most holy of explosions were the only thing that was powerful enough to get my father home from the milk store after 18 years   true story guys  i swear   h2 the mechanics of making you feel like a god  h2   trepang 2 gives you a  b tight  b  movement and stamina system where you are rewarded for playing well  kill an enemy  get a short burst of unlimited stamina which is used to run  slide  jump and kick  sliding is one of your main offensive and defensive tools  106 has apparently soaped his buttocks up with an endless amount of butter because when you press that little slide button you will go fast enough to barrel through a group of enemies  sending them ragdolling around like bowlingpins after a strike  sliding is also the only way to move backwards fast so when 5 different guys are aiming at you with homing miniguns you better have stamina enough to get away chief the stamina system works well with the focus system in that you need to damage enemies to get that focus meter up to slow down time  meanwhile invisibility is time based recharge  so it is a perfect balance of action and resourcemanagement that only gets more intense as you ramp up the difficulty and get more hair on your chest  h2 difficulty  balancing  awesomeness   h2 the difficulty slider goes as follows and can be changed between every mission  easy  normal  hard  very hard  extreme  rage mode  now a normal game made by cowards would do the connection between  moar helf   moar difficult  well trepang does away with that and instead tweaks every part of the game mechanics except for the enemy health to bring you the masochistic joy that is the harder difficulties  the resource management gets harder as every kill gives you less and less focus the higher the difficulty and the damage you take becomes much more punishing  on extreme  you will only be able to survive a couple shots before dying  on rage mode you can take one or two bullets  you will have to master timing of invisibillity to get out of the way of fire  the game becomes high stakes one man gorilla warfare where anything less than perfection means you die  and  i  love  it  while dying becomes as easy as breathing  autosaves are handed out like candy after every ass kicking so you never lose that much progress and can jump right back into the fight  the pacing is fantastic with death only acting as 4 second breathing breaks and if the game ever gets too hard  just switch on a lower difficulty   rage mode  is called that as a big d move from the developers for a challenge against those that have mastered the game mechanics  the skill floor is low but the ceiling is tickling the moon with how high it is  you are expected to play through the game multiple times to learn the mechanics like the back of your own hand chief  i m gonna be real with you  i am not much of a  shooter fan  in the  classical  sense  you could even call me ugh  a casual  but this game opened my eyes like a  b divine revelation    b  amen  chief  i did my time playing it once on the  normal difficulty  and was hooked by the graphics  music and sheer riveting gameplay  once i had gotten out of my  post trepang clarity  i knew i was never going back to playing anything less than trepang quality games  i had gotten a taste of that good stuff and i wanted more  so i played again on hard  then very hard  then grit my teeth and went through extreme and thought  surely  they can t make it any harder   then i played rage mode    it was pulling teeth  it was bloody  i cried a little   but i loved every second of it  those you love are the ones who are able to hurt you the most  chief  i now know what that means  trepang 2 taught me that  and i kept coming back  even after every achievement had been gotten  i set my sights on the combat simulator and with a smile only a mother could love  went and beat all of that the game can be hard  but the hardship is more satisfying than anything else i ve ever played  even if you aren t the masochistic type  anything bellow extreme difficulty is just fair enough where you can have some casual silly fun  h2 closing remarks  h2 another thing i did not touch on was the cheats  remember when developers had the gall to put unlockable cheats in their game as an extra unlockable for completing the game fully  yeah  i thought it had gone with the dinosaurs but trepang 2 is here to slap that notion on it s fat greasy cheek before injecting it with  substances  by completing the game and various challenges you get to be freaky with the game and a wide variety of cheats you can switch on to

tacos tiny lizards with a feathery tail  oros white chicken sized dinos  avas  small ceratops  and velos small raptors   the first two are slow and easy to catch  don t go after the avas until you can catch up to them  the first three are harmless  velos will attack you if you are a hatchling or a juvenile  you will learn their cries pretty quick  6  if you are not hungry  or a herbivore  and you

lana who lives a pleasant and comfortable life within a small community  unbeknownst to her  a looming threat is becoming nearer  a threat that will destroy the harmonious balance between mankind and nature  before long  the tranquillity is abruptly shattered  and her best friend ilo is taken  the village is in shambles and malevolent robots have taken hold of everything she once knew  this begins lana s adventure to pursue the robots and find her friend  but she does not face the journey alone  it is not long before she meets a small and adorable creature named mui  mui becomes lana s companion for the remainder of the game and plays a fundamental role in the gameplay  https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2981256553there is no dialogue  as the characters appear to speak a fictional language  but the narrative is told through the beautiful surroundings  landscapes  soundtrack  and the tone of lana s voice  the story is not something entirely new  moreover  similar stories have been told many times  but it provided more than enough intrigue and mystery to keep me interested   it is a story about friendships  courage  and cooperation  a heart warming tale that mixes the essence of these themes  and thrusts them into a puzzle  sci fi adventure  h1 gameplay  h1 before going into detail  the gameplay is more on the simpler side of adventure puzzlers  if you are looking for something challenging  something with multiple different solutions to puzzles  or a game that may leave you stumped for a few minutes  this may not be the game for you  planet of lana excels with its graphical beauty and atmosphere  and whilst its gameplay is not bad by any means  it is not complex gameplay is almost solely based on companion style puzzles  light stealth elements and platforming  lana cannot directly attack the robots  so she must sneak past them  hide in long grass  and utilise mui to reach higher places  hit buttons and so forth  mui must be directed to stay or follow  chew through wires  jump up to a certain spot and more  timing is typically the biggest challenge with these segments  i did feel that developers aptly introduced new mechanics as the game progressed  expanding players options so it never felt repetitive  mui learns a myriad of new skills and lana uncovers new ways to control the robots  there is no inventory management or puzzles involving picking up objects and the simplicity helps keep the game in motion  becoming stuck on a specific puzzle would feel out of place to me  as this would ultimately deduct from the wondrous atmosphere that the game oozes  the game is also very forgiving and autosaves frequently  if a robot spots lana or mui  unless blocked  it will automatically kill them  despite being heartbreaking to watch mui die  there are no real consequences to this  as you will just respawn almost exactly where you died https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2980441389the entirety of planet of lana mostly follows the same formula of companion style puzzles  however there are some quick time events splattered in latter sections  the ending of the game also felt unusual and slightly out of place  but i can only deduce that the developers were trying to do something different for the finale  and it wasn t too jarring to negate the game s previous accomplishments  there are also some collectable shrines to be discovered throughout the levels  but this is the only extra content the game offers  and these are also linked to achievements  i did not find all the shrines  but i still took approximately 6 hours of playtime to finish  stopping momentarily to soak in the gorgeous environments surrounding me  however  i have seen some people reach the credits in 3 hours or less    b  u bugs   issues  u   b bugs were very minor and scantily impacted my experience  however there were enough to be noticeable  during a scene that is supposed to be a swell of emotion and triumph  the foreboding eerie music from the previous scene was still playing  detracting from this moment entirely  in retrospect  this ill matching audio only happened this one time  another bug that i encountered a handful of times seemed to be caused when trying to exit an animation too quickly  resulting in the character staying in a statue  unable to interact with objects or jump  just stuck forever in a t pose until i reloaded my save  h1 visuals   sound  h1 undoubtedly the most standout feature is the gorgeous visuals  with a plethora of motley landscapes to trek across  ranging from deserts to lush green forests to barren caves and factories  another impressive element that cannot be fully appreciated from screenshots alone  is the excellent camera and cinematography  despite being a side scrolling adventure  planet of lana does not feel limited by this  often in large scale areas the camera will pan or zoom out  giving an entirely different view to players  there were never any issues with this  it never felt unresponsive or awkward  it just worked  and it worked flawlessly  i also must mention how utterly delightful mui is  the small cat like creature bounds gleefully at lana s heels throughout the game and is simply adorable whilst there is no dialogue  the soundtrack matches the level of quality seen in the visuals  aptly capturing the highs and lows that lana encounters  understandably so  as this original soundtrack was composed by takeshi furukawa  a highly acclaimed composer known for his work in  i   avatar  the last airbender  the last guardian  i  and many more https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2981196679 h1 technical   stats   h1  quote  b this game was played using a controller  and with the

peggle and slay the spire  for fans of turn based roguelikes  i can highly recommend this game  and more casual fans will also find tons of enjoyment from peglin with the many orbs and relics  h1  the positives   h1  h2  difficulty   h2 peglin is very beginner friendly with the lower level cruciballs  this game s progressive difficulty  being pretty easy  but not completely free  it s forgiving enough to allow for experimenting with the over 100 orbs across 4 unique characters and the plethora of over 150 relics if you re looking for a more challenging experience  then peglin is also great at that  there s currently 15 different difficulty levels  with an extra 5 planned  called cruciballs  all of which build off of each other and make the game many times harder  similar to slay the spire s ascension system   it ll take a lot of learning the orbs  relics  enemies  bosses  and characters to overcome the challenge  there s also a pretty big skill ceiling to this game  when you first start the game it may feel a little unfair at times  but as you play more and more  you start to get better at the pegboards and choices you make  h2  replayability   h2 i want to make something clear  this game does not have 274 2 hours worth of content  however  this game does have a ton of replayability and plenty of fun to it  i ve had so much fun playing this much of peglin and i m looking forward to playing even more of it  as mentioned before  there s hundreds of orbs and relics across 4 different characters  even more than that  the core gameplay mechanics are just satisfying to play and watch  some builds completely destroy the pegboard dozens of times over  sometimes you reach millions of damage in a single shot  and sometimes you super buff your character with extra strength and plenty of healing  the way that all of the orbs and relics synergize with each other leads to near endless amounts of combos and different ways to win  most of your time playing peglin will be experimenting around with the different ways to win and how far you can push the game  and that s the most enjoyable part of the game  h2  graphics and sound design   h2 the game s pixel art is beautiful and very fluid  all of the characters and enemies have amazing animations and designs  the soundtrack is excellent and i highly recommend checking it out at some point  especially the castle boss music  the gameplay is super fun when you re hitting pegs  and the sound effects further enhance it   hitting pegs  refreshing the board  getting critical hits  etc  all sound super satisfying  h1  the negatives   h1  h2  cruciball progression   h2 as i said during the difficulty section  the game does feel a little unfair at times  especially once you reach the cruciball 10  section of the game  i personally had no trouble getting through the first 10 levels without too much difficulty  but then the bombs get heavily nerfed  making the early game much harder  it s not impossible  but the last 5 cruciball levels are individually harder than the rest combined  h2  unlockables   h2 i personally enjoy how there s not hundreds of unlockables  like how binding of isaac does it   but some may not feel the same  the only things you unlock are the 3 unlockable characters  cruciball levels  and achievements  however  the game still keeps track of every orb and relic you take in the custom start menu so you can still work towards filling that out  which will take you a while   you don t unlock any extra orbs or relics for the most part  but this isn t the type of game to need that  h2  length   h2 each run is only half an hour to an hour max across 3 different acts  there is a secret 4th act planned to be added later in the game  but as the game currently is  all of your runs have you going through the forest  castle  and mines every time  some variation in the acts would be very appreciated  such as having different themes  i personally enjoy the shorter length of runs as it makes the game easier to pick up and replay  but some players might feel like the game s a little short  if you consider each run taking around an hour across 15 cruciballs per character  then you still have easily 60  hours of gameplay  so the game is beefy enough to replay  h2  fowl damage   h2 this section is a small tangent on how some people believe that this game s  abandoned  for a new game that red nexus games is working on called fowl damage   this is completely false  peglin has been actively getting updates approximately every month or so  adding more orbs  relics  enemies  and balance changes  fowl damage is also only being worked on one of the seven developers of peglin  so this game is anything but abandoned  i only bring this up since one of the top reviews of this game claims this and it paints both peglin and fowl damage in a bad way  h1  overall   h1 for an early access game  peglin is certainly worth your time  there is tons of fun to be had throughout the whole game and it is incredibly replayable  while there may not be tons of unlockables and content on the surface  there is more than enough for peglin to still feel like a full  complete experience  the core gameplay s addicting  the orbs and relics are all super fun  and there s endless synergies  all backed with a good amount of optional

something similar  found this game and tried it let me start by stating some really important things about the game   you will need the wiki open  i see tons of reviews of people who got stuck because they didn t know what to do next  this game contains very little direction in terms of what to do  you might need an item for a quest  and the only way to get said item is some hidden npc selling it and the game will never tell you  we can argue wether or not this is a flaw of the game  but if you plan on playing it  don t make the same mistake other players did  i myself tried to do it on my own and fared pretty well for a while  but about 10 hours in had to give up and look up some things on the wiki this game is similar to stardew valley  but not the samethe basic concept is the same  you have a plot of land on which you can do quite a few things  there is a town with npcs you can interact with  the overall ambiance is relaxed and warm  you have  chores  to do to progress in a multitude of ways  there are some objectives  but at the end of the day you could just stay in your spot and do whatever you want  no pressure or stress to complete any kind of objective the difference with stardew is the progression  in this game  the primary means of progression is through a tech tree  through certain actions of certain nature  you unlock specific science points that allow you to unlock technologies to unlock new items or crafting stations  these items you ear are usually needed for quests or quality of life improvements the npc system  in my eyes  is actually better than stardew s  in this game  most npcs have quests for you that are part of a bigger storyline  and when you complete a quest for an npc you earn reputation with them  allowing you acces to certain services or dialogue options  this feels far more interactive and fun than stardew s friendship system  this is   in my mind  probably one of the only thing this game does better than stardew if you liked stardew valley  there is a decent chance you will enjoy this game  they are similar  but have some fundamental differences                                                                                                                                    now let s talk about the game itself  you start off as a regular guy who dies and goes into some strange other dimension and become a graveyard keeper  there is a graveyard  and a steady flow of bodies to the graveyard  your job is to embalm them and bury them  burn them  throw them in a river  whatever  that is the basic premise a part from this  the main underlying quest is our character wants to go back to the real world  and every npc you meet usually gives you quests when you ask them for help  those quests usually require you bringing them items or accomplishing something the quest system is pretty fun  you meet npcs  they give you quests  and you try and work to complete them  what is nice is a lot of npcs tend to get intertwined with other npc s quest lines and i just find it overall fun and interactive this is where we get to the main feature of this game   the tech tree  your actions in the world earn you tech points that allow you to learn new technologies  these technologies are usually to make you stronger  more efficient at certain tasks  or allow you to create new crafting stations or items that can be required for certain quests  the tech tree makes this game   complex   for lack of a better word  often you ll need a technology for a quest  but then you will need another technology to use that technology  and you need another technology for that one  and so on and so forth  you can find yourself in some pretty deep rabbit holes sometimes in terms of what you need to do  personally  i love problem solving and therefore this part of the game  but it isn t for everyone the game includes things such as fishing  farming  mining  combat and so on  later in the game there is the ability to automate certain tasks and make your life far easier the overall tone of the game is a curious one  not in a bad way  just special  at it s core it s pretty macabre  you bury bodies that you often remove chunk from prior to burying them  you can take out from the body and make a burger with it  or sell it at the bar with an illegal royal stamp so it looks legit  anyone analysing this kinda feels like this is messed up  however  it s all presented in a light hearted funny tone with nothing being graphically explicit  personally  i love this tone  but some people might find it strange and unamusing the graphics are great  they are nice looking for 2d sprites with nothing groundbreaking the game has two big issues for me  first of all  the mandatory use of the wiki  pretty much everyone who doesn t use the wiki will get stuck and uninstall the game  use the wiki  i personally don t mind this  but some people might the biggest issue in my mind is the price tag  this game  at it s current default price  is in my eyes too expensive to justify buying  it s good  but not that good the game currently sits at 20 usd  to me this game is probably worth  at the most  13 15 usd and 20 is kind of pushing it  i was able to get it at a 65  discount for a price of 6 7 usd and for that price it is a complete steal tl dr   this game is pretty great but too pricey  i recommend getting it if the price falls below 15 usd",2023-07-07,2023-07-07,True,35,0,0.804097592830657959,0,True,False,False

adventure rpg developed by freebird games and released in 2011  on the surface  the game appears simple   the retro graphics  straightforward point and click gameplay  and lack of action or combat don

like love  grief  regret  and meaning   td   td   gameplay is very limited  mostly just dialogue and basic point and click  puzzles are simple  short playtime of around 4 hours  some technical issues like resolution  no options menu   td   tr   table   h2 story  h2 at first  the premise seems straightforward   dr  eva rosalene and dr  neil watts exploring johnny s memories to implant a fabricated one  but an incredibly moving romance emerges as players slowly uncover the tragic history between johnny and river we start at the story s tragic conclusion  johnny s unfulfilled wish to go to the moon before death  working backwards heightens the mystery and creates natural dramatic irony as players know johnny s fate before learning what befell the couple  as they explore his past  a tragic love story unfolds  in his youth  johnny met river  a blunt but charming woman with asperger s syndrome  though their personalities clashed  they fell desperately in love  but when river fell ill  refusing treatment  johnny constructed a house by a cliffside lighthouse hoping to fulfil river s dream  h3 story structure  h3 the game only reveals johnny and river s backstory in fragmented snippets  parsing vital details through memory flashbacks  interacting with meaningful objects like johnny s mementos or environments from his past provides satisfying detective work piecing together his relationship with river  h3 character design  h3  b dr  eva rosalene and dr  neil watts  b on the surface  eva and neil seem like insensitive doctors just doing their job  but as the story progresses  glimpses of their personality shine through  neil uses humour to cope with the problematic nature of his work  at the same time  eva tries to remain professional but can t help getting invested in their clients  lives  their cynical banter gives way to quiet reverence as johnny s tragic story leaves them profoundly impacted  b johnny and river  b at first  johnny seems like a curmudgeonly old man longing for his lost love  but through the memories  we learn he has a quiet tenderness beneath his gruff exterior  meanwhile  river s asperger s makes her logical and literal  still  she has an astute emotional intelligence  knowing the right things to say to comfort johnny when distressed  their quirks complement one another  making an unlikely but perfect pair  h2 music  h2 the serene piano chords especially move during memory scenes as players explore poignant remnants of johnny s past  these contemplative pieces evoke nostalgia and longing  transporting us into johnny s mindset as he reflects on happier times with river meanwhile  the subdued technological sounds accompanying present day investigation scenes nicely reflect the scientists  clinical  emotional detachment as they routinely purge dying peoples  memories  yet slight warmness breaks through at moments  hinting that even the jaded doctors are invested in johnny s plight  finally  the ending song  everything s alright  provides a bittersweet closure  combining gentle piano with lyrical vocals and strings   h2 art style  h2 visually  to the moon adopts a straightforward 16 bit graphics style  sprites move stiffly through flat  low detail environments  however  this primitive aesthetic complements the emotional narrative rather than detracting the visual simplicity creates an ironic contrast with the story s sophistication  johnny initially appears as a stereotypical grumpy old man but secretly harbours profound romantic devotion  the doctors look detached but care deeply  the deceivingly emotive pixel art style embodies the dissonance between superficial appearances and inner complexity  h2 conclusion  h2  to the moon  utilises its interactive medium to tell a resonant tale of love and loss through its unconventional reverse chronological story structure  melancholy soundtrack  and deceptively nostalgic pixel art visuals  the game proves that superior writing  music  and thematic intent can sometimes surpass bleeding edge graphics and mechanics in creating a compelling gaming experience   to the moon  delivers an unforgettable interactive narrative that stays

the game that is super addicting and fun to do  there are some gripes with the building mechanics though  my main issue is just the lack of items for the outside  no parks or anything of that seems pretty bland  just some lights  a bench  and trash bins  also some bushes and trees  also you don t get any visitor parking  you can create your own for aesthetics  but they are not functional which was a shame  you only get ambulance parking  and that is pretty strict in terms of placement  now the interior building is where it all shines  making your rooms for specific jobs is easy  and they even tell you the required equipment for all the rooms so you are not lost in trying to find the needed items which is a huge blessing  you can get really creative with the builder tools  you can also hire staff as well  every staff has some better expertise than others  with a cost of extra money   and with some extra perks  you can even create your own staff member from the ground up with their looks  age  and profession  you can even create your own character and become the doctor  being able to do surgeries  diagnose patients  and help out in epidemics can be an intense  immersive  and

they were crosscode fans like me  i figured maybe i d enjoy it too  my opinion of this game was a veritable rollercoaster at first  but after a while  it settled on positive when i saw the screenshots and videos from the steam page  they got me excited to play  the combat looked fun  and the carefree exploration seemed to be exactly what i wanted from a game like this  so i bought the game  started playing it  and let me tell you  my excitement quickly turned to pessimism at first the problem is that  in the introductory parts of the game  the story and setting were giving me the impression that this was gonna be a bland and clich  rpg  stop me if you heard this one  you re a young and eager whippersnapper from a small medieval town  and one or more of your parents is deceased  when you reach a certain age  your caretaker encourages you to go out into the world to become a soldier  warrior  adventurer  or whatever all the  super cool hero guys  are called in your world  you explore cities and towns  look for npcs with exclamation marks over their heads  and they give you a generic fetch quest to do  all that combined made the first few minutes of the game rather bland to me the presentation didn t help the game s case either  don t get me wrong  it s very well made  but its style deliberately emulates the milquetoast  inoffensive fantasy aesthetic of certain retro rpgs  you get cutesy chibi characters  monsters that start out adorable and eventually become terrifying  typical medieval tilesets  and the semi adventurous musical style you d expect to hear in this kind of game  all that further enhanced the feeling of a clich  rpg in my mind after the end of the introductory bits  the game finally let go of the reins  and that s when my opinion started turning arond  the first thing that made the game click for me was when i went back into the arena after the tutorial mission  and was presented with an optional challenge that absolutely demolished my behind  that s when i started to realize this game was not gonna hold my hand all the time  and it made me excited  the fact that the arena also allows you to fight overleveled versions of bosses further cemented this point  and proved the game aims to reward player skill to an extent  rather than focusing entirely on character stats like many rpgs often do what i like about the combat is that you re able  and expected  to evade enemy attacks  rather than just doing the old tank and spam of similar rpg titles  the game does not give you a dodge move by default  but it s still possible to block and move away from attack hitboxes  i love me a dodge roll game as much as the next guy  i beat dark souls more times than i can count   but i ve really been craving more games like the classic 2d zeldas  where you can evade enemy attacks through positioning alone  so this hit the spot quite well some battles are basically bullet hell battles  with intrincate patterns of projectiles to be avoided  while other battles feel straight up souls ish  with enemies having telegraphed attacks and you needing to find an opening to counter without exposing yourself  both of these battle types will be deal breakers for different kinds of people  but i  for one  enjoyed them quite a lot  and appreciate the variety they bring to the table the second thing that made the game click for me was walking around an inconspicuous crossroads area  and finding a decent amount of optional treasure in it  just like  say  a link to the past  there is tons of non critical stuff you can get by exploring a little bit  so even if you don t like doing npc quests  you ll still not be short on equipments and upgrades  also  fast travel is unlocked super early  which further encourages you to venture forth without fear  and significantly cuts down any backtracking  i also quite enjoy the zelda like lock and key aspect to the exploration  with some paths being inaccessible until you have certain items  as there s something strangely satisfying about finding an item and remembering a spot you can use it in finally  the last thing that made the game click for me was the variety of weapons and spells the player can use  it s not as varied as  say  dark souls  but it s varied enough to allow for lots of character builds and even challenge runs  heck  i bet it s even possible to beat the game with no skill talent upgrades if you re crazy enough to try it  since the game does not force you to distribute your points after a level up  i eventually reached a point where i was so satisfied with the game that i started not minding the npc quests that much  and even the fishing minigame became fun  the story has a self aware comedic tone to it  which is very understated at the start  hence my fear this was gonna be another generic rpg  but becomes more evident as it goes on  when the more comical and cartoony aspects of the plot started kicking in  the story became quite enjoyable  and i even started liking some of the characters  especially the sarcastic sentient bag that is handed to the player by their father at the start of the game all in all  i d say the lesson i learned with this game is that you can t judge a book by its cover  if i had immediately alt f4 d after rolling my eyes at the intro bits  i d never have discovered the fun in this game  i d sum this game up as  2d zelda but it s an rpg with challenging combat  and recommend it to anyone to whom this description is appealing",2024-03-23,2024-03-29,True,37,1,0.806489050388336182,0,True,False,False

gone if i switched to  not recommended  the developer has responded exclusively to the old review  it will be available at the bottom of this post as a pastebin link  as this review seems to already exceed the max character limit  the old review is left here for convenience  and context the review bombing is justified                                 11 03 24 update another blow for the f2p players  a nerf to gems earned through boss encounters has been introduced  essentially you can now earn gems from up to 300 encounters per day  this was not announced anywhere and caused massive outrage in both reddit and discord because of it  and of course  as expected  censorship occured  threads were deleted  and bans happened  this is insane  h1 tl dr lava introduces actual gacha mechanics that are way worse than actual gacha games  i am disappointed with the way this game is going developer decision wise   h1 so  i ve been an avid player of the game for a while  but who would have guessed that a tactic that was once applied to idle skilling would come over to idleon  and it s in a much worse state that i could have imagined this game had minor gacha systems in the gem shop for a while  ever since world 4 was released  and it was partially fine   there were methods for getting the premium currency  the bonuses were alright for the price and while there was some backlash for it  people in the end accepted the system as it is however in this update  we got cursed with another wave of gacha systems  and it certainly tops other games in terms of how scummy and p2w it has become you get one pull per week of a certain follower  and it can give you bonuses  which range from nonexistent to downright gamebreaking  devaluing entire classes king doot  which we can call the 5  character  currently grants the ability to get all divinity gods linked to every player on one s account  divinity bonuses are nothing to scoff at  as they re super large bonuses  x6 printing value  lab becomes optional  30  afk gains  etc   the current odds of receiving it are 0 28   a f2p player would need over  b 6 years  b  on average in order to get that follower  before you lash out in the comments saying  oh but the odds get higher    please let me elaborate  there is no potential way to reduce the timer or to influence the odds other than rolling more  and the rolling progress resets at every new  batch of characters  which happens every 10 weeks     statistically speaking  you will not reach the third tier of odds before the new batch appears  the argument still stands there are many other currently available  characters  that devalue other abilities and ignore limits that were imposed because of the game s mechanics  but i really don t want to go on too much about it in order to have additional rolls for these characters  you need to pay green gems  which on paper sounds alright  but note that at the time of editing this review  there is no way of acquiring that currency as a f2p player  the only source is by donating real     to the dev  the cost for these gems is twice as large as normal gems  other gacha games at least allow you to farm for that  but here  nope  nothing  nada  you get nothing  you lose  batches of characters  means that these business practices will continue and repeat several times with every new update introducing potentially new gamebreaking benefits  while inducing fomo to every other player that has not acquired the top tier characters yet  if one hasn t received the characters now  how long would they have to wait in order to have a chance on getting them again the tactic of introducing a gamebreaking feature with a premium currency unavailable for f2ps was introduced in idle skilling before  however  is s version is much more acceptable compared to what was done here in idleonit sucks to see such a great game go downhill like this  i hope things get better  but unfortunately it s likely not going to change  given that lava  the dev  has likely already amassed 7 figures through this mechanic  and did not address the drama that happened around his game  only praising himself for the  success  that it brought both financially and playercount wise  he doesn t understand that it came at the cost of trust of quite a part of his playerbase if you decide to play this game  know that the dev in the end will milk you for your money after making it look like he s super gamer friendly  he s pandering towards whales  instead of the f2p community like he advertised  past tense used intentionally my trust in the dev feels used  this is why i have trust issues                                  h1 old review  h1  the one the dev reponded to   https   pastebin com c3wvqgjv                                 h1

please spend a minute and consider whether you re the target audience the game is trying to pander to  don t fall for the scummy predatory tactics   edited the initial review to acknowledge the past edits 1 07 23   an update has been released  with no changes to the companion mechanic  aside from king doot  the  5  character   to have an unforgiving pity of 200 rolls   lava has stated  albeit ambiguously  that the mechanic is going to stay the way it is   lava has not addressed the backlash  and only praised himself for increasing the playercount despite that increase in players likely being due to ios players moving up to steam in order to take part in the companion mechanic  purchasing green gems on ios was disabled at that time  and due to sponsoring a youtube video  he clearly ignored all the negative feedback thrown at him  selectively responding to only the positive messages in the server  he clearly misunderstands his community  or at least the ones that have concerns   url https   i imgur com skiy7jl png he did  however  respond to a negative post by pulling the  if you don t like it  don t play it  card on a member of the community  url   his attitude towards the entire situation feels super childish  there are way more messages sent by him in the server  just do some searching   a few hours after the update i have been muted on the game s main discord without a ping or reason given  likely permanently    url https   i imgur com y8c2krv png i strongly believe my messages at that time were in no way harmful to the community  the dev  or the game  url   this is wrong   the edits caused the review to exceed the character limit  so i cut the old review and inserted a pastebin link with that same old review for anyone interested 25 06 23    there has been no official developer response ever since the p2w gacha nightmare has been released  if this doesn t say enough about his attitude towards his game s playerbase  i have absolutely no idea what does  all signs point at the fact that he s abandoned the game and is cashing in on the rest of his playerbase  please do not defend this behavior   there are speculations that lava  the developer  has already amassed seven figures through this update alone  this very likely may cause these business practices to keep on being introduced  assuming any update is ever going to come   cheaters have already

setting   writing    b set in a war torn land  chained echoes places you in a nation who hasn t known peace for many generations  lives  you start out playing as a mercenary glen who s supposed to go on a quick in and out mission  this sets in motion the events of the game which involve a weapon of mass destruction  angry petty gods  and reincarnation  this gives way for many points of intrigue in the story  all of this is engaging until the last bits of the game which seem to throw the player for a loop completely  sometimes instances like these capture the player  i was not one of those players  the game ends with a cliff hanger considering the main issue doesn t get solved  when credits rolled  i sat back and just thought to myself that it ended weaker than i expected     b  gameplay system   bosses    b what chained echoes does to stray away from the classic turn based is introduce an overdrive gauge  this gauge moves with every action taken  split into orange  green and red  the overdrive gauge brings strategy into how the player chooses their actions  each special skill is classified and using a skill that matches your overdrive gauge will move the cursor inside  the objective is to stay in the green for added advantages such as extra damage and reduced skill cost  if the overdrive reaches the red  enemies do more damage and skills cost more  bosses take advantage of this gauge by using moves that mix out the normal order of the overdrive gauge  later  the game introduces  badass  mechs that players can pilot that add an extra dimension to area traversal and discovery  these mechs do substantial amount of damage and change the overdrive movement by linking it to  gears  of your mech  having your mech in a certain gear will move the gauge in a given direction  this change alone keeps the game from just mashing the skill that does the most damage  sometimes you ll have to sacrifice a few turns to make sure you don t go in the red and suffer the penalties    b  quest  mini games   challenges    b  chained echoes side missions are not hard to miss  which i love  at a point in the game  you will be able to go off and adventure in your sky ship straight cid style  looking at your map you will be able to discern the side missions that you can do and points where to go next  as a person who doesn t have as much time as i used to play video games  this streamlines everything for me  the content of each side mission varies  but for the most part they hit  there are some heavy hitting side stories and others are pretty lighthearted  in classic rpg form there are secret boss fights that test the build of your group  there are also special beast hunts that only occur if special conditions to make them appear are met  both of these task do reward you with special equipment and weapons for your troubles    b  miscellaneous  art  music  etc      b the game employs the classic 16 bit sprite art concept along with full bodied adventure jrpg soundtrack   there were some definite bangers in there for me such as rohlan fields  it does a good job of making a high fantasy sound track that tickles your nostalgia

review can be read at the bottom  i  b women of god become extremely horny over drinking holy water   b taboo trial is a short 3d action roguelike that you can complete  your first full run  in about 4 hours  i personally really liked the shorter length of the game  because it means each run you ll most likely be able to beat the boss that killed you last time the english translation of the game is a bit rough in many places  but generally i had no trouble understanding what it was trying to say  the story is very basic at it s core  and anything beyond  kill the boss to open the way to the next area  is ultimately quite forgettable the steam page mentions  partial controller support   which basically boils down to  combat works perfectly fine  menus can be a bit stubborn to use  you can t rebind keys  you can rebind on keyboard  just not controller  b bosses  b there are 8 bossfights in the game  but in reality it s 4 bosses with either different movesets or  boss you ve seen previously  but now there s two of them  type situations  they aren t the flashiest fight on the market  nor the most memorable  but the movesets are decent enough fun  although some hitboxes could use adjustments  b spells abilities  b if my memory serves me right there are 5 or 6  spell  type abilities in the game  most of them have a  ability  version  a button key that you have to press to activate  and a  passive  version  smaller version of the same effect  has a chance to trigger through another action ability most of them are decently strong  and if you get good upgrades with them you ll be able to melt bosses in the matter of seconds   b weapons  b there are only three in the game  greatsword  greataxe  and a spear  the latter two need to be unlocked with items that drop from first time boss kills  they all play about the same in the beginning  they all have a light 3 attack chain and a heavy attack that costs energy  you can upgrade the light attack or completely change what the heavy attack does if you find the specific upgrade for them   b playable characters   b there are 7 playable  characters  in the game  the difference between them is only cosmetic  they all use the same weapons and upgrades   and you unlock them by giving them a specific boss drop item  holy water  three times  you can only gift one item between runs  even if you have more than one in your inventory  which seems like a bit of an odd restriction now  you as the player don t know these characters personally  but the moment you gift them holy water they re pretty much down to fuck on the spot  like full 0 to 100 on the horny scale within seconds  there isn t actual sex or nudity in the game  but the dialogue  and character illustrations that you get after the first gift  can be very very suggestive  b difficulty   new game    b after you beat the game once you ll unlock difficulty  options  up to  3 to begin with  that as far as i know go up to  i at least  i   10   3 is a small but noticeable difficulty increase from your first playthrough  you also need to add an extra modifier to your run  which adds either extra health and damage to enemies or environmental hazards that you need to be aware of  the higher the difficulty  the more modifiers you need to pick  you also get extra money and  heart of spirit   used for permanent upgrades  on higher difficulties   b visuals  b the game takes norse mythology aesthetics and sprinkles some shiny futurism and technology on top of it  if you re looking for a faithful retelling use of norse mythology  this game isn t it  the game takes names of people  creatures and places from nordic myth but doesn t really connect them back to it in any meaningful way  either way  i really like the environments of the game  especially the snowy areas in chapter 2  whoever in the team is behind the visuals of this game gets a thumbs up from me  b missing content      b few of the loading screens show more organic looking enemies  specifically some type of dragon and another giant lizard creature  they don t actually appear in the game  which is a shame   unless they re some kind of secret difficulty 10 endgame bosses but i kinda doubt that   i hope that they re some kind of content planned for the future  because they both look really cool and i want to fight them    b performance  b i have a rtx3060 and putting all the graphics settings to the highest drops the fps to around 20 30  the main culprit seems to be the fog setting  changing it from high to normal made the game run perfectly fine a fair few people have also reported issues with lag and crashes  and there seems to currently be problems with certain amd and nvidia graphics cards  i personally didn t encounter any of the former  besides the fog lag   but i ll still mention it here to make people aware that there is a possibility of performance related problems                                      b old review   b  i this is a  first impressions  review about an hour into the game  since there aren t many reviews in english and i imagine people will be curious to know more than what the steam page tells them  i believe it or not i didn t come her for the anime waifu ass  as much as it seems to be center of advertisement  the character you start with did kind of gave me nier automata vibes  maybe it s the white hair  strike and the anime waifu ass   strike  but what actually caught my attention and dragged me in was the mix of norse inspired aesthetics and funky robot creatures  i had the money to spare so i gave it a shot  and    it s actually pretty decent i m gonna be real  i was half expecting this game to be a scam or something  i tried to look up info about the game and dev online before buying but found absolutely nothing  except a link to the official discord that had less than 10 members  on first launch my antivirus gave a warning pop up  which it eventually cleared after scanning the files  it s not a great start to launching a game  but i wasn t about to let that stop me  once you press start the game immediately drops you to the first level and gives a brief combat tutorial  the best i can describe the gameplay loop is that it s hades  almost identically  you move from room to room and pick rewards as you go  and bosses drop items that you can trade in for other stuff and permanent upgrades in the hub room combat feels alright  reading enemy attacks and dodging in time can be a bit of a pain but i imagine it s one of those things that you ll get better at as you repeat the bosses over and over again  the skills you can pick on runs seem to have pretty good variety to them  i m only a handful of runs deep at the point of writing this  and so far i ve had a slightly different approach to combat each time  first run my skills were more focused on applying a damage over time debuff to enemies  and another time i was slapping enemies around with heavy attacks  based on trailer footage there are plenty of abilities that i haven t even come across yet  b tldr   b  the game feels good to play for the most part and i really like the aesthetic they ve gone with  i don t have any major complaints so far but we ll see if that changes as i get further into the game",2023-08-02,2023-08-06,True,76,2,0.831794857978820801,7,True,False,False

related stuff  stop now  my review is for the people who buy the adult dlc  found even on steam  anyone who doesn t use said adult dlc  please stop now reading my review since it s not for you  all in game character are 20 or over  up to 1000 in npc editor  but no lower game get many updates  new dlc and more  so what i write might become outdated like the other guides in the steam guide sectionsquick summery  you can have harem or if you select  the girls will sleep with guest  something that is easy to control since as the game begins  you are asked if you wish ntr block on  on   no one but you will touch them   if said warning  the moment you press start  did not show up   you don t have the adult patch correctly installed  also  dlc s are needed for pretty much all adult related  i don t know if i m correct  however  without any dlc   no adult stuff  aka each dlc  on top of what they add like story  or visual  they also add new sex related options events behaviours  keyword  yotogi  anytime you see this in dlcs  it meas something sexual   dlc add new yotogi    new sex position and or events   so if you buy a dlc  in the yotogi section  new options  corresponding to said dlc  will show up  if they don t  or have error   run the adult patch to update the adult dlc step 0  have money  a lot  since most stuff are behind paywall  dlcs  and more are added on steam with time  this is why many reviews suggest to buy base game   dlcs  like the gp01step 1  buy the adult dlcthe adult dlc  not patch   on steam  or any other websites   when you start the game  said patch will apply automatically  if nothing showed up  it means the dlc did not work  aka just on it s own it doesn t add all the stuff automatically  instead  once said dlc is is active  you need to download the adult patch that will update the dlc to the latest versions  due to risk of ban i will not post any links again  the next 2 steps  are in case the adult dlc did not work  via the dlc management  you can instantly tell if it worked  if you launch the game  and you have  guest room  as one of the options  alternativly  the monent you press start  new game   1st thing that shows up is a white screen asking if you want ntr    girls cheating  block on or off  block on   girls won t cheat   if you did not see this  it means patch did not work  so continue to step 2  otherwise  move to step 4step 2  find and download the adult patch that will update the adult dlc to the latest versionthe patch is free  no account  nothing  but requires the paid dlc  i used the steam one  and yes  it works step 3  dlc manager to actually activate the dlc so they will show up in gamewarning  start the game non vr mode  so that the dlc manager show up  all instructions are self explained on said dlc manager  also  start the game non vr since  in vr mode  create mc is skipped  that includes naming mc  no clue why  no issues in non vr mode step 4  grief note  mosaic censorship  so even if the adult patch works  there is mosaic step 5  hope at the cost of  actually reading  read me  or else blame yourself why step 5 isn t workingand you guess it  there is a mod to  fix  the issues  again  can t post link  there are enough post about it so you will find it easily  and said mod has instruction  readme  bonus  you need to select a folder in  custom order maid 3d2 it s a night magic      name of the steam version of this game   aka look where the  exe file is  that s the folder you need to set as a destination  you can tell if it s the correct fonder if the mod installation will work without it giving you a warning  something like no  exe detected vs no warning and that s it bonus 1  each time you get a new dlc  ensure you start the game non vr to use the dlc manager to activate them  if some don t work  please go back to said dlc s steam page  and scoll down the description of said dlc  the one written by devs  to see instructions as some need to move files from a folder to another  see next bonus 2  warning  if you get   5   xo  dlc  the one that lest you customise male mc  like real face  hair  and all   tons of visual option for the girls   there are issues with compatibility with other dlcs  aka each  character  dlc is like a personality that is added  said  5   xo dlc might will prevent some event s since it s only compatible with certain  personalities   dlcs   so ensure you do your research  this dlc also will not be activated automatically via the usual dlc management  so go on that dlc s steam page  and read the description  scroll down  a lot   as you need to move files from folders to another  i hope this issue wil be solve soon  btw  again  read the description of said dlc for extra steps  moving files   as otherwise you can t access your  before installing dlc  save file3  if you are in vr  ensure you change the  click to jump  to the other one that allows you to move for a better experience since it s more easier to  adjust  the  view  angle  i use a quest via quest link air  i don t know if this is still true if different device is used hope this mini guide is helpful as i wasted hours trying to make it work  only to realise the solutions are easy  i just didn t know what i was supposed to do",2023-11-28,2023-11-28,True,15,0,0.679919242858886719,0,True,False,False

i won t say that it s the greatest game i ve played  but sow stands solid on its own right   here are some main pros and cons i took away from this game pros   decent narrative  though at times gets needlessly convoluted     good dialogue writing   much better than fire emblem engage  though that isn t hard i guess     some very unique and fun character designs   i particularly like the sayunaari character portraits     some very fun artifact item options allow for incredibly effective mechanic exploits that can turn your units into masters at their specific roles  whether offense or defense  etc   army customization mechanics are enjoyable and can take hours of your time just on their own   it s always fun to see your army grow from a ragtag assortment of conscripts to a conquering force   characters are  for the most part  well fleshed out and likeable   each one from what i saw was written well  though zelos could have stood to have much  much more exposure on his specific journey due to the large role he plays in the story   more exposure on his journey and the gradual shaping of the motivations that led him to act the way he did would be nice   otherwise  i found myself enjoying the cast   sybil  beatrix  and lysander in particular were my favorites   overall a refreshing take on the turn based genre   the ending clearly leaves room for a sequel  and i await the next chapter of this storyline and would love to see where the crew goes next cons   romance supports feel incredibly rushed   fire emblem sometimes struggles with this  but at the very least  the fe method of support pairing usually involves at least 4 supports going from c  b  a  and then an a  or s support ranking that allows relationships  whether romantic or platonic  to develop with a more natural pacing   sow would do well to take inspiration from this setup  as the romantic and platonic pairings that they envisioned as canon feel extremely rushed and hollow since quite a handful of romantic pairings happen on the very first support with barely any prior interaction  if any at all   more cutscene interactions  and more supports in general  would make most of these pairings feel more natural and carry more weight   i will say that i do enjoy how with certain pairings  they had external acknowledgement of your pairings from other characters  such as in the case of sybil and barnabas and the wedding arrangement  which was pretty nice to see   they should do something similar with other pairings and perhaps even the mc s pairings   the boss fight is wayyyyyy too easy   by the time you advance to that final chapter  most players are likely to have a very powerful army  and the boss does not seem to scale well to that   i beat the boss in 2 3 turns with my 60k threat level beatrix and zelos squads   but this isn t a huge issue since it can be easily fixed   the unique mercenaries are needlessly expensive considering that many of them have average stats     the ai of your units attacks can be very frustrating at times   for example  with any ranged unit  the  target leader  command seems to result in only a marginal emphasis on targeting the leader   the bigger frustration for me was when my units would overkill a single enemy unit with all of their attacks  consuming a turn and wasting potential damage on other enemies   the ai should be tuned to ignore enemies that have already been dealt enough damage to be killed off rather than having your whole unit target the same 1 archer for a million damage while the units behind it escape notice   the option to sell class change materials such as horses  iron or gems should be implemented   towards the latter half of the game  you ll likely unlock a tech tree option that causes the refund of dozens of class upgrade materials retroactively  specifically iron and obsidian   at this point you ve usually settled on your squads and class options  so having 60 iron and 40 obsidian sitting there when you could be buying mercs or rare artifacts instead would be nice     a few missed opportunities for some new unique additions to the cast and more interaction in my opinion  such as general ragavi or a certain brooding ninja assassin     some character endings left something to be desired   for me  this was mainly with zelos  as although the mc s whereabouts were examined  no such insight was given to the dark knight   i have never taken this much time to type out a review   i am overall quite satisfied with the game  and more importantly i see it as a very promising start to what is hopefully a long and successful series that constantly improves itself with each iteration   i only put more writing in the  con  section to see improvements made  as i really wouldn t care enough to provide feedback if i didn t see a lot of potential in sow   fans of similar games would do well to check this one out and support the

about  you guessed it  heists  in swh  you re in command of a group of pirates who are in turn commanded by captain piper  after the earth is almost completely destroyed  its robot inhabitants are forced to head into space  despite being a crew of pirates  the objectives in the game are actually focused on helping the common folk rather than taking from them as you might expect  this involves boarding enemy ships and completing one of several possible main objectives most of your time in swh will be spent breaking into other ships and then dealing with the objectives for that given ship  most of the ships are just levels you need to complete to get to levels which actually advance the story  for the most part the main objective on these kinds of levels is to collect a certain amount of swag  the name for loot in the game   story levels have different objectives based on how the ship s role in the story  for example  if the ship has some kind of special item it ll probably be stored in a locked vault so you ll have to take out the ship s generators to open the vault for some ships  completing your objective is fairly straightforward  you ll meet some stiff resistance but once they re dead  they re dead  however  a fair amount of the ships in the game have alarm systems  depending on how big the ship is  you ll have a certain number of turns before the first tier of the alarm goes off  generally  the first tier deploys the ship s turrets but if there aren t any turret positions one or two enemies will be deployed every other turn  the alarm then resets and starts counting down to tier two and then after two it moves on to three  the higher tiers mean you ll either get a group of three enemies or a  special  enemy who s more challenging than your average foot soldier  from my experience  it s pretty much impossible to complete your objective on a ship with an alarm without reaching the first tier  i found this quite frustrating at first but the idea has grown on me  the game needs that extra layer of challenge for it to remain  for lack of a better word  challenging  if every ship has a static number of enemies then they d all be far too easy and while the non alarmed ships definitely have a place in the game  i found the alarmed ships to be more enjoyable because they made me think more carefully about what i was doing and ultimately i was better at the game when playing those levels swh s gameplay is focused around the aiming mechanic  instead of an rng based system like you see in most squad based strategy games  xcom and the like  your ability to hit your opponents is based entirely on your own skill  some weapons  scoped pistols and sniper rifles  have a laser sight which helps you plan your shot  though the aiming with this isn t completely steady so there s still some challenge with timing the shot  but all other weapons require you to  eye ball  it  early on in the game you ll probably be sticking to fairly safe shots but it is possible to use ricochet to hit enemies you can t directly aim at and this becomes easier to pull off the more experienced you are with the aiming in the game  hitting your target with a crazy shot that bounces several times is incredibly satisfying speaking of weapons  there are quite a lot of them  ranging from basic revolvers all the way up to rocket launchers  all weapons have a damage stat and a critical hit stat  how much extra damage you do when you get a critical hit  and some weapons have other stats too  such as  can t shoot after moving   sniper rifle and  friendly fire   grenade rocket launchers   not all steambots are created equally  they can t use whatever weapon they want  every steambot has a class  for example there s the  brawler  class which can only use handguns  but deals higher melee damage  and there s a  vanguard  class which can use handguns or assault weapons  smgs and shotguns   as with all squad based strategy games  finding a good combination of classes to use is key  most missions allow a squad of three crew members  though i ve also seen one  two and four crew missions  so it s usually wise to have a close range  mid range and long range fighter  different classes also have different abilities which are unlocked when you gain enough experience to level up  sometimes when you level up you ll unlock something fairly basic like  1 health but the abilities you do get are incredibly useful  as is a health increase to be fair   some of these abilities are passive  such as steadier aim for the sentry class if you haven t moved that turn  while others are active such as double shot for the vanguard class which is self explanatory as i mentioned earlier  every ship has  swag   loot  for you to find  generally  loot is found in the form of loot bags but every level also has an epic swag box  these boxes usually contain special loot and they also grant you a reputation point for that level  you get three in total  two for completing without any deaths and one for the epic swag   reputation points are used to unlock new areas of the map but some characters who can be hired as crew members require you to have a certain amount of reputation to prove to them that you re worth fighting for  most loot bags contain water  the game s currency  but you ll also find weapons and equipment and the occasional earth relic which can be sold for a substantial amount of water  equipment ranges from grenades to health kits and even armour  as well as other things  and each crew member has two equipment slots your inventory space is fairly limited  though you can buy and occasionally find upgrades for your inventory space  so you ll quite often have to sell off items to make space for new ones  the only items that don t require inventory space are your hats  hats are basically swh s version of collectibles and there are three ways to obtain them  first  all crew members have their own default hat so hiring a new crew member will get you one new hat  secondly  you can shoot an enemy s hat off  they can do the same to you  and then go and pick it up  adding it to your collection  lastly  there are hat shops in the game where you can buy new hats from  there are also shops for equipment and weapons   while they don t alter any of your stats  they are a nice little customisation option a couple more things to mention  swh s focus is definitely on gameplay rather than story but the story is pretty entertaining and there s a good bit of humour in there  all of the game s sound effects are great and the soundtrack is also very good  it does feel more natural playing with a controller and i enjoyed it more but it is definitely playable with kb m  h1 verdict   h1 swh is an excellent squad based strategy game with challenging and engaging gameplay and plenty of content  oh and cool hats  lots of cool hats  whether you re here because you played the previous game or you re just a fan of strategy games  this one is well worth picking up  i  url http   steamcommunity com groups lonerangerreviews curation lone ranger reviews   url   i el

and the splash damage from explosives   and even enacts the unsteadiness of the aim which requires both calculation and perfect timing of the player  which further heightens the challenge   it also has that added satisfaction when you land a calculated no scope mlg pro shot  and that surprise factor when you accidentally hit an enemy that wasn t planned  overall  it brings a very wholesome gameplay that makes you wanting more and more         b tons of content  b    from the numerous items  weapons and equipment  and swag  for you to collect  to the various characters available to recruit and play as  and the dozens of challenging missions that you can engage on  you can easily have a day s worth of hours in gameplay time that awaits you  oh  and the hats  have i mentioned that there are various hats  like cat on top hat or some anime related hat  available for you to suit up your steambots         b brilliant soundtracks  b    not only that the sound effects perfectly fits the sci fi steampunk nature of the game s theme  it also showcases some really nice songs soundtracks that catches the ambiance of what a classic midnight bar should be  my favorite track is  i  honeybee   i  by  b steam powered giraffe  b          b clean game graphics  b    similar to the developer s earlier game  steamworld dig   this new entry to the series presents a very clean art design throughout the whole game which is something that i always expect a game would have since not only it looks visually appealing  but also prevents possible confusion that players might encounter in terms of either the game mechanics or menus    list   h1  u  b the cons  b   u   h1  list         b lack of ability choices  b    to be clear  i am pertaining to the lack of  skill trees  that are normally available in role playing games  while the game is great at its current set up  i do think that it would be more enjoyable for players to be able to customize their preferred characters rather than blindly waiting for the abilities power ups unlock as they level up  for example  you kept on playing a certain character that you got early in the game because you already invested the experience points to that one just to know that another character is more suited to your preferences play style          b no co op multi player mode  b    unlike the x com and worms games  both of which inspired the battle system of this game  the game only has single player story mode available  at least during this review has been posted   in which is pretty important in terms of replayability and gives its players the option to enjoy the game with their family  friends or even duke it out with their rivals         b repetitive gameplay  b    same old nemesis by the games from this genre  while the game is very fun and challenging that will occupy you for hours and hours of gameplay  it doesn t deny the fact that the same gameplay is presented during the course of the game  i was actually excited when i reached one the point of the game where a certain npc tells you about a  brawl club  that you can join in since it might be a mini game mode added that is different from the regular battles  and while that mission did introduce a new part of the game  where it introduced a three way battle between you and two other factions  the battle premise is no different which was disappointing in a certain way    list   h1  u  b final thoughts  b   u   h1 for those who are fond of turn based games  this game is easily a  b must buy  b   and for the people who even have the

wear out its welcome before the credits  i think the biggest crime the ascent commits is prompting you to set realistic expectations and then still failing to meet them  practically a textbook case of  less than the sum of its parts   the first thing you ll notice is that for an action  rpg   there are barely any meaningful modifications you can make to your character  some basic aesthetic choices  including gender  and nothing else  no backstory  no base stats or perks  nothing to differentiate your character from any other  does the game promise rich character choices  not at all  but don t expect any welcome surprises here  even as you continue to progress through the game and level up  you ll notice a severe lack of depth relative to the apparent complexity of the systems and menus here  there are several character stats to assign points to at each level  but if you manage to decode the needlessly vague descriptions  or simply look up build guides like most people   you ll find that there aren t so much build  guides  as build  guide   there is arguably one optimal way to build your stats  perhaps two if you really want to split hairs  and once you discover this  any illusion of choice or  role playing  basically vanishes  armor all has fixed stats and you quickly run out of new gear to buy  same with weapons and augments  weapon progression is linear and global  meaning if you upgrade one type of gun  any copy you pick up maintains those upgrades   so money quickly becomes completely irrelevant  there is no economy here  no consumables besides the powerups that spill out of enemies and vending machines to be instantly used  and no inventory  progression is gated by the main story  your character level  which indirectly controls your health and the damage you can do  and your cyberdeck  which you again find linear upgrades to over time  can t open an ice 2 door  upgrade your cyberdeck until number go up  now interact with the door to open it  there are 4 damage types  but only two classes of enemies in the game  organic and mechanical   so only two of the damage types are particularly relevant  ballistic and energy are generally good  with ballistic being better against organics and energy better against mechanical  digital is practically useless against organics and fire is practically useless against mechanicals  but without any way to permanently alter the type of damage each weapon does  there s no point in trying to specialize  i can t help but imagine this game could have been much more satisfying as a pure shooter without any of these vestigial systems masquerading as rpg mechanics  especially if the effort spent on them could have been deployed elsewhere combat fares far better here  although again  there s a decent chance you ll tire of it before beating the game  most weapons and abilities have a satisfying punch to them  the gorgeous explosions create gobs of debris and particles  and enemies  and unlucky npcs caught in the crossfire  are often dismembered or even vaporized on impact  enemy variety is quite good and forces you to dodge  maneuver  and prioritize targets effectively  that is  until you match or exceed the level of the enemies you re fighting  at which point they become cannon fodder  all areas have fixed level ranges which don t change over the course of the game  so in the second half you will be powerful to the point of tedium compared to your foes  especially if you equip a weapon with homing bullets and an aoe augment  you can basically autopilot your way through most areas in the game  there s no need for build diversity here  even in coop  because the most effective strategy is always to kill or suppress all enemies before they reciprocate  environmental destruction is completely aesthetic  don t expect to be strategically removing cover or flanking through exploded walls here  finally  a couple of the most powerful weapons in the game are only found in the final missions  where you maybe have a couple of hours of gameplay left  a new game   mode was patched in after release  but offers no compelling reasons to continue besides a familiar sandbox in which to briefly play with these new toys  no new gear or weapons  no changes to the story  as far as i could tell   and minor gameplay tweaks which have a negligible effect on combat  melee enemies get shields that absorb some damage  ranged enemies throw more grenades  i m sure there are others  but i just couldn t be bothered to push further the story is barely worth mentioning  there s some neat tech behind it with the use of proceedurally generated voice lines for npcs and a lot of conceptually interesting lore  but it doesn t say anything meaningful  and the impact on the world you re navigating is basically nonexistent  there are no choices to be made and nothing in the way of character development  one of the npcs repeatedly complains about failing to keep a low profile when civilians die  but to zero consequence  civilians respawn  enemies respawn  life goes on finally  this game is exceptionally pretty  the artistic direction in the details and animations are absolutely awe inspiring  and on a high end monitor or tv at max settings  there are few games that can match it  yes  the fixed third person perspective is doing a ton of heavy lifting here  i m not directly comparing efficiency or technical excellence   but beauty for beauty s sake is not enough to sustain a game  and while i think the ascent s visuals will age beautifully in a broader sense  they re not enough motivation to keep playing  especially when you reach the final tier of the world and discover that it s far smaller and less detailed or impressive than the three preceding levels  to a degree where it looks almost like a symptom of cut content so given everything i just wrote why would i ever recommend this game  well  assuming your expectations are now finally set accordingly  i think there s some fun to be had here for the right person  my advice would be to look up a build guide and the locations of a few interesting weapons  then just completely ignore the rpg mechanics  play a few of the early side missions  they get less interesting and more fetch questy the further on the game goes  and then just cruise through the main story once without spending too much time exploring  you won t find anything interesting  trust me  if you re the type of player  like me  who needs to see what s around each corner and inside each crate  the answer is always meaningless bundles of currency or a piece of equipment you already picked up 5 hours ago  this world and the mechanics surrounding it are perfect sequel bait  perhaps with enough support this team will get the chance to make a game that isn t just competent  but surprisingly good 7 10 buy it on sale  lol",2023-10-08,2023-10-08,True,112,1,0.878253340721130371,0,True,False,False

end  i kept wishing there was more of it  overall  i found it to be a solid  enjoyable action adventure game  and a wonderful first entry from ember lab heading into the game  i didn t read anything about it  and so i didn t know what to expect besides the extremely vibrant environments and the adorable rot companions  the beginning of the game was  admittedly  a bit slow  most elements of the game felt a little bit underwhelming  from the combat to the platforming  and i ultimately put it down for about a year  what a mistake that was  when i picked it back up about a week ago  i realized i d left the game off at the exact point where it starts getting good   combat  first off  the major bosses are incredible  their animations are extremely expressive and give an epic feel to the fights  extra kudos to the corrupted woodsmith fight  the way the music pauses for tension  before it it soars while the boss begins hammering away at her forge throwing up enormous rings of fire everywhere was glorious  all of them were memorable  and give me an itch to go straight for a master difficulty playthrough even though i ve told myself i wouldn t some have described kena as a soulslite  as some parts of its combat  between the dodge rolls  the need to recognize and know how to precisely punish a boss s attack animations  very limited healing in combat  punishing damage from bosses  and the way you need to weave in and time your own attacks  are reminiscent of souls games  admittedly  when the first major boss turned out to be a giant hulking wolf guy with a big  glowing sword who leaps at your face  i had mildly traumatic flashbacks to maliketh  the black blade from elden ring  i played er first  although kena was released first   one of the challenge trials features a double boss that  again  gave me mildly traumatic flashbacks to godskin duo i personally really enjoyed the varied range of skill expression possible with kena s combat  there is an expectation that you will use kena s entire kit in combat  and this holds true through the end of the game  mastering her kit can mean flawlessly chaining her abilities in combat and defeating bosses without taking a hit  not doing so means panic rolls and  oftentimes  death  there s a solid chunk of puzzle elements in combat as well  and as a long time zelda fan  i really appreciate having this kind of gameplay present  especially when it s so absent in the most recent zelda games   master difficulty update i think that master difficulty really helped the game s combat shine even more  on ng  master difficulty  most of the early game encounters are revamped with endgame enemies  and getting hit is substantially more punishing  both in the amount of damage you take  and the courage loss it incurs   i actually died once during the tutorial because even those fights were revamped and yet  despite this increase in difficulty  i found that the game already gave many useful tools for handling all of the combat scenarios  virtually every attack in the game is parry able  even if the timing is painfully tight on a lot of them  many attack sequences are staggerable using dash  at the cost of draining your shield meter  and risking getting caught without that valuable resource   enemies deal more damage  but they die in the same amount of time  meaning that the gameplay heavily rewards reading the enemy s attack patterns  split second reactions  thoughtful target priority  and freely swapping between defensive and aggressive play  several bosses also picked up new phases and attacks in ng   overall making the second playthrough equally  if not more  interesting than the first   kena s toolkit  in fact  kena s toolkit is the element of the game that has grown on me the most  as mentioned before  the combat expects you to fully utilize the tools she has on hand  i really appreciate that these same tools are used in puzzles and traversal  it really gives off a classic zelda like feel  for example  the puzzles involving her spirit bomb ability can activate various types of machinery and  most important  can temporarily activate various forms of debris into little platforms  this same underlying logic comes into play with some enemies and bosses  where you can  activate  parts of their armor and rip it away from them temporarily to expose weak points   story  the writing is a little basic but overall gets the job done  given kena s inspirations  i wasn t expecting much more than what we got  after all  zelda games often have plots that boil down to  link does heroic things because he is a heroic dude    but i appreciated how the characterization felt very grounded  no one in the game is doing evil things because they are a bad guy  most of them experience very real and relatable pain that they just can t let go of  until kena    beats it out of them i guess    despite kena s vibrant  cute aesthetic  the writing is not really for children  it would not have resonated with me as a child  but it certainly resonates with me as an adult   platforming and exploration  the platforming mechanics of kena were a little bit basic  the climbing elements were drawn from the likes of uncharted or tomb raider  but don t get any more complicated than just shimmying along or hopping between ledges  i found the platforming puzzles overall enjoyable  even if they were a bit simple at times the usage of kena s toolkit in platforming was a very enjoyable start  lining up grapple points mid air is fun  if a little easy   and the spirit bomb puzzles added a mixture of control and dynamism to the platforming the exploration mechanics of the game could have used a little bit of work  the map ui could have used a way to add player waypoints  and there isn t really a clear way to detect things like extra rots for those who are trying to 100  the game   more   however  overall  the feeling i got from kena was  i want more   because the elements we did get were woven together very nicely  i could imagine adding two or three more skills into kena s toolkit  adding more regions to explore  with more complex platforming  and more complex bosses  and it would go from being an enjoyable ride to an incredible one  i see this as a good thing  as this is ember labs  first game  i feel like they nailed most of the elements they needed to  and the overall degree of polish feels indicative of great future potential  i look forward to seeing how they grow for their next game   kena 2

the cameras so i would not be seen  and make a dash for the murder scene  opening the apartment with a key found under the door mat  a short brown haired man is sitting on the couch  next to a toy car  i whip out my handcuffs and arrest him  i proceed to the bedroom  finding a body crumpled over itself  there is an 8mm cartridge next to the body  and another toy car  i take the victim s prints and analyze the body  she was killed by a handgun  i run to the handcuffed man and search him  he has an 8mm handgun  got him i hear the security door raising  so it is time to leave  i run out of the apartment  just as enforcers rush through the security door with weapons drawn  i head to the neighbor s house that i had just sneaked through and knock on the door  they answer  i ask if he had seen anything strange recently  to which he provided that a short brown haired man was seen around the apartment at the time of the murder and they were clearly angry  got him the enforcers are still around  so i head up the stairs  looking for the building s management office  i find it on the 7th floor  i pick the office s lock and close the door behind me  i open the surveillance footage  and navigate to the cameras outside the victim s apartment  only the victim and the short brown haired man were on camera  nobody else comes or goes from the apartment  got him i head back down to the

suspicious  might be worth looking into digging into the victim and spouse s email histories  they both seem happy together  maybe it is not this guy  scanning the rest of the apartment  all finger and foot prints match the victim and spouse  that small toy car is the only exception  i should try to find some other leads  i place a tracker on the spouse  then head to the victim s workplace once there  i notice a picture board behind the counter showing the victim and her co workers  i pin the co workers  profiles onto my murder board before seeing a note nearby   the password to the office is 1234   classic  i punch the code into the door  turn off the cameras  and open the filing cabinet  the worker files have fingerprint data  so i grab them for all the co workers  no matches to the toy car by this point  the victim s spouse has been released  so i use the tracker to find them  i ask for their name  which they provide  and if they saw anything suspicious  they give me the same spiel about a short brown haired person in the apartment  odd that he would provide that statement  given it is a match for himself  the evidence all points to the spouse  but his cooperation and that darn toy car are dissolving my confidence with no additional leads  i start investigating the victim s neighbors  i start in the lobby  scanning the mailboxes around the victim s floors looking for fingerprints  no matches to the toy car  i scan the doors of the neighbors from 3 floors down from the victim to three floors up  no matches  maybe it was one of the building s staff  i break back into the management office and review the worker files  no matches  what is going on here  then it happened  another murder is reported on the scanner  this time on the other side of town  i race to the scene  trying to beat the enforcers again  the security door is shut like usual  but there are no nearby vents  the enforcers run up behind me  so i stand aside  letting them clear the scene  i knock on a neighbor s apartment and a small woman answers the door  i get their name and fingerprints  then ask if they saw anything suspicious   a short brown haired person left at 0645   the same killer as the first victim  i wait for the enforcers to leave and sneak inside the victim s apartment  i analyze the victim  killed by an 8mm handgun  there are six 8mm cartridges nearby and    another toy car  i scan the car for prints  and they match the prints from the first victim s toy car  the killer is taunting me  i run through the apartment looking for any info  the victim lives alone  works at a nearby pharmacy  and does not have any apparent enemies i sneak back out of the apartment  past the guard  and start searching for the management office  finding it  i open the filing cabinet and look at the worker files  still no print matches  i jump on the cruncher  and look through all the individuals that were on the victim s floor  trying to find a short brown haired man  when it happens    at 0645  a short brown haired man was seen going down the stairs from the victim s floor  i pin their profile to the murder board  but i have no name  address  place of work  or anything i could use to find them  i head back downstairs  deciding to show the picture to the neighbor  maybe she could confirm if this was the man she saw the neighbor answers the door again  and i show her a picture of my lead   oh  i work with him  his name is  redacted   i saw him leave the victim s apartment at 0645   we have a solid lead now  i run down the stairs and out of the building  entering a nearby phone booth  i open the city directory  find his address  and head to it i arrive at their front door and scan for prints  no matches to the suspect  i knock on the door and a small blonde woman answers  i ask for her name  which she provides  and her fingerprints  which she refuses  i ask if i can show her a picture of the suspect  but she is not interested in identifying anyone  she is not being cooperative  but what can i do    that is when i see him  a short brown haired man matching the surveillance footage walks by an open doorway behind the woman  i make a split second decision to stop this here and now i whip out my truncheon  knock out the woman in front of me  enter the apartment  and shut the door  the short brown haired man turns the corner  drawn to the commotion  the truncheon goes back to work and he goes down too  but not before he got some punches of his own in  leaving a bruise on me  i search him  he has 8mm ammo  got him  i take his fingerprints  they are a match to the toy cars  got him  i handcuff the man and begin searching for the murder weapon i search through the home finding work info  sales receipts  birth certificates  wallets  but no weapon  nothing in the kitchen  nothing in the bedroom  bathroom never has anything  although i did find some paxadol for my bruise  i dig through the office  nothing  i dig through the living room  nothing  finally  i spot it  there is a drawer on the hi fi gramophone that i didn t notice  in the drawer there was a self help book  underneath the book was a silenced 8mm lazarus 5

death  gunshot wounds  no casings left at the scene tells me that the killer used a revolver  i break into an arms dealer s shop at night  rifle through his sales records  there are eight people who bought guns or revolver ammunition before the first murder  it s an illegal arms dealer  so details are scarce  but i ve got eight last names and that s enough to go on  i use the city hall s database and start checking the names  first up  a  rossi  anatobella rossi  it s her  the prints match  she bought a gun a few days before the first killing and it seems that she was a fast learner  i get her workplace and her home address  i know she s dangerous so i grab a ballistic vest and get on over to her apartment  it s 11 am  she s at work  so i knock on the door  her partner opens it  no time for games  i push my way into the apartment and handcuff him in the hallway  and start my search  the murder weapon isn t here    rossi is probably carrying it on her  i open every drawer and cupboard  break into her safe  nothing incriminating  but now i know where she is for sure  i go over to her office and ask for a tour  the receptionist is friendly  let s me in  i go down the line of cubicles  rossi is at the end  she s sitting there  typing  a marketing manager  of course    who else could be capable of such violence  i savor the moment  but it s time to finish this  i handcuff her and search her    there s the revolver  that s all i need  i got her name  her address  her prints at the crime scene  the murder weapon  and the perp in cuffs on the floor  it s a cold walk back to city hall to hand in the case  i get paid  less than what i d get if i done some dirty work for a corporation  but it s enough  i head outside  over to the bar  i m getting thirsty   h1  the game   h1  that was a long story  so i ll keep this review short  shadows of doubt solves the perennial problem of mystery games  how do you allow the player to be entirely responsible for solving the mystery without running the risk of accidentally stopping progress because they can t solve the puzzle  the answer is that  through procedural generation of the cases  failure is not a wall  it s a door  if i had failed to solve that case  there would be no consequence beyond the continued killings and the knowledge that i just couldn t do it  you need to be a good detective  but the game gives you everything you need in order to become one  that case was especially difficult  no other killer gave me as much trouble as rossi did  so far   with procedural games  there often reaches a point where a savvy player begins to understand the systems well enough such that they can engage at a purely technical level  will i ever reach a point where i d be able to say  okay  this case is of  this  type  which means that if i go  here  i can find the likely killers   maybe  i m not there yet  but if i ever reach that point  i will have absolutely gotten my money s worth in time and stories like the one above",2023-04-30,2023-04-30,True,980,30,0.96101456880569458,0,True,False,True

required  discretion necessary  if you re unfamiliar with corpo talk  it s a polite way of saying  we need you to rob somebody   the pay raised a few red flags  four thousand crows for a job like this usually meant minimal evidence to go on  but i needed to pay rent and keep the heat on  so i picked up the phone and dialled the number a few twists and turns later  i was holding a briefcase with the details of the mark  and it was just as i suspected  all the client had for me was a fingerprint  the mark s blood type  and the fact they had blue eyes  you have to wonder how they can get that information  yet somehow more identifying features elude them  would it kill them to get a last known whereabouts  a head shot  maybe  but i digress   point is that i was going to have to canvas almost the entire city to figure out who this person was before i could kick their door down  so i grabbed a coffee  and headed back to my apartment to figure out my game plan my first thought was go through the government database  and brute force it until i found a citizen with matching prints  but something told me that if i sat in an enforcer s office for several hours straight wasting their printer paper  i d wind up on my ass outside city hall with several new bruises  it would have to wait until i had a little more to go on it was then i had an idea that would narrow things down somewhat   this is a corporate client  asking me to commit corporate espionage  ergo  it would make sense that the mark would be a member of another corporation  i highly doubted that they d be after information from adrianna s pawn  that left four possible locations to work with   coral compounds  henkerson s workhouse  azure industries  and the whole iwasaki cascades tower block  the first three wouldn t be much of a problem  but iwasaki was another story you see  iwasaki is a combination residential and commercial property  floors 1 4 are residential  5 10 are office space  and 11 13 is the penthouse level  the good news is that it would contain almost every corpo in the city  the bad news is that it would contain every corpo in the city there was no way around it  this was going to take a while  so my plan was simple  head to the security room in each of these buildings  and get  cctv photographs of as many unique people as i could  then once i had those photographs  i could eliminate non suspects by going through the list and checking them against the mark s description  if they had a known non matching print or eyes that weren t blue  they weren t suspects so that s exactly what i did  i grabbed a snack and some kola  headed to iwasaki s security room  wedged the door in case any enforcers got cute  and started scanning the previous day s security footage  several hours later i had a list of 90 something potential suspects  some of them i knew  some of them i d never seen before  repeating the process at the other locations got me to well over 100 potential suspects  i headed back to my apartment  grabbed another coffee  and started narrowing down the suspect list  bringing me down to 20 of these 20 people  some of them didn t have names  but since i had a photo  i could probably ask around the residential floors of iwasaki to get those  so with my list of 20 suspects in hand  i headed over to city hall  flipped a few crows to the supervisor at the front desk  and sat down at the government database  now i was looking for a print match  unfortunately  i came up blank  i now only had the 6 or so people remaining on my suspect list with an unknown name  but a known location  so i went back to iwasaki  and started asking around i was worried at this point  i d scanned 100 people and come up blank  while i did have a contingency plan   do the same thing at restaurants next   i knew that it would make things much more difficult  after all  you re not just looking at one block at that point  people from all over the city patronize burger joints  i d have to start looking all over the city flagging down a corpo and asking if they knew people directed to me to ash networks  which gave me a few people to look at  a look on the worker board gave me names for three suspects  and i figured since i was there i d at least scan the employee files to see if i could get a print match   avoid pissing off the city hall employees any more than i had already  you know jackpot  a matching print  and a photograph confirming who the suspect was  i had my jane doe with that sorted  i pivoted  this person had some documents which the client needed  the question was where  so i headed to ash s safe  found the code for it from a note on the break room fridge  and punched it in  nothing  i waited for the target to go to the bathroom  then rifled through her drawers  nothing  chances are it was probably at her house  so i logged onto her company profile  turns out she lived three floors down in apartment 202  that was where i would have to go it was around this time that work was getting out  so i was overstaying my welcome in the office  i left and made my way down three floors  waiting for the target to get back  as soon as she got in  i broke into the power box on that floor  engaged the security doors  and turned off the cameras  just to make sure nobody tried anything  then i booted the door  took her and her partner down with my baton  and started my search again  it wasn t in her personal safe  but after checking her drawers i found it  i left the two lovebirds with likely blunt force trauma  maybe a concussion  and went to hand in my document  after all  that s what corpo health insurance is for  right i won t say it s the easiest 4 000 crows i ve ever earned  but it was by far the most

devastating battles of world war 2  from squad sized engagements to army size engagements not excluding company  battalion or even division size battles2  you have available to you  provided you pay for extra d l c  each and every nation that had at least some influence in combat of some kind during the war  i couldn t believe my eyes when i saw indian infantry regiments as an option to play with  yes the allied nations to the british  not enough how about the infamous russian female sniper units or the hitlerjugend  yugoslavia  romania  poland  france  italy  south africa    it is crazy they thought of everything 3  now to the good bits even better than the ones mentioned so far  you have actually a very welcoming array of features that gives you the historical accuracy feeling a game like this should make you feel  from different calibre sizes having different velocities and as well as accuracy to small things like infantry or tanks that can t cross a certain depth of water  unless they are aquatic  you have the invironment changing around you as you play like destroyed buildings  those affected in anyway with physical force  but not any force a force big enough to be capable of doing said things   craters left by artillary  tank shells  grenades  mortars  anti tank guns  anti tank rifles etc  you have trees able to be bent and run over by big enough tanks  no not all tanks can do so   vehicles that pass over terrain leave distinct track marks  going as far as to mimic the width of the tracks that ran over   authentic voice lines for each nation i mean each nation  tank crews or any vehicle or aircraft that requires communication via radio is going to have that gravily radio voice but it goes further as sounding like those radios used back then  vehicles and infantry have all realistic speeds when moving  each vehicle and infantry type was given particular detail to the speed based on with infantry the weapon carried and any kind of carry on equipment as for vehicles miticulous research made on the different speeds those vehicles went  off road and on road same for infantry and includes planes   other details like he rounds that give clear splash damage with an incendiary effect  with the effect looking bigger based on calibre being used   infantry  tanks  planes  other vehicles  fortifications with weapons etc  have all accurate combat ranges  example the tiger 1 with a max combat range of well   2000m  yes you read right 2000m and yes you can search the tiger 1 data tables and confirm this is so   penetration rules are calculated on historical accuracy data such as shell to armor plate diameter  angle  distance shot and this depending if you have aces like michael wittman haha yeah he is here  the effectivness of the tank statistics are more like accuracy  reload speed stuff that would rather make sense  there is line of sight rules with heavy forests having the greatest hiding effects and light forests having lesser effects all the way to inclines and declines and tall grass and wheat and ofcourse if you decide to pop a few smoke shells with a sherman or artillary or mortar crews  units have historically accurate camouflages and uniforms  going as far to solely include a uniform or camouflage that was used by that particular unit in that particular division in that particular battle   the base game gives you access to 600 or so different types of units with exstra dlc able to top you up to 1000 something if not more  just go look up each dlc and see how many they say they include exstra   infantry actually look like men with rifles  submaschine guns  anti tank launchers  mortars  anti tank guns you name it and not pixelated nonsense  mentioning the different terrain type for example tanks can t cross into heavy forests but anti tank guns and infantry can  tanks and other vehicles can go into light forests tho obviously infantry as well  the game has symbols otherwise completely banned from other games like the infamous swastika   planes for example have them  so if you like the bf 109 or fockewulf enjoy the detail  some units have their correct unit number or division symbol on them to say they belong to that particular division  some audio sounds are tried and true to sound as authentic as possible like my favourite the katyusha rocket truck  very scary   units have the historical accurate amount of ammunition on them  there are different critical hits to vehicles like tanks like broken tracks  broken turret ring  engine destroyed  drivetrain damage stuff like that  there is on move penaltlies to accuracy with some units fairing better than others like the sherman  speaking of on move penalties some units which were designed to fight while stationary like the tiger 1 that had to remain motionless in order to engage does so  i can t there is more  but i can t think of everything ok latly infantry and all units have a level of stress and if it gets to a certain level they reduce in combat effectivness  some units which had a morale factor like leaders and commanders negate these effects  going as far as disheartened units  units with no longer a belief that the war is winnable  they still suffer this effect   units have a level of optical strength like scouts having the best compared to tanks with silly viewports  don t mean the optical sights on the guns   you do not have magic maschineguns on tanks firing without any reason there is a visible crew member shooting it  the sherman with the browning maschinegun is an example   path finding of units actually very good  close calls like driving very close when passing through  but acceptable this includes infantry and tanks not driving over them  they drive around or stop  not yet in the game  but special tank rider infantry types are coming bringing a very new mechanic to the game  there is more but i don t know  oh each unit type has a name  a accurate name that would be given to that man or boy in that nation this excludes aces with their actual authentic name given  and finally all units have realistic reloading speeds based on caliber size  loading technique  unit s skill level  damage done to increase the time etc 4  general things i saw that has me worried some tank on tank fights don t seem to have this penetration rule as for example a tiger 1 does not knock out a t34 of any kind or sherman from my tests at stupid ranges like 100m to 500m heck to even 2000m it still should happen with one shot  on the second shot the tank dies  which is unaccurate  it should be a knock out or some form of crew damage  not nothingsome units like planes they look like they have a seizure  able to yaw left and right blazing fast  the issue is not that i am saying they don t have accurate yaw speeds with the flaps  i am saying they do this sometimes for no reason even on leveled flight  a bug perhapswhen you destroy some form of in game asset like a building or even a fence  as soon as you are over that exact asset again  the game will make it look like it just got destroyed by literally falling again like it did before  again a bugnoticed that fires created by flame thrower infantry or units  foot units are able to pass through fires 10m wide with no harmsome info on the statistics tab of the unit in the   armory  don t make alot of sense with some for example ppsh 41 wielding units having the correct 1254 rpm to a low 700 and something and even lower sometimes depending on the unit type and how many there are tanks practically have the same death type loop for all tanks  you will see what i mean  same goes for planes and other vehicles  but it looks too good to not like it as it is actually realistic the way you die there are sometimes sound deferentiations if fights get really big and intense  it goes softer than normal",2023-06-08,2023-06-08,True,30,0,0.701839029788970947,5,False,False,False
140994541,76561198083065751,0,1,21,0,21,2023-07-01,english,"well well before i totally forget i kinda want to put my 2 cents into it as well  since its only just and right to write a review when youre done with something i spend almost 2 years playing this game  got considerably far and yeah fell a tiny bit to the  micro transaction offers  more about that later     so lets start with the pros  hmm hard to think of sth    jk lol we have an idle game here which tries its best to offer as much stuff as possible without being overpacked with complicated stuff  aka multiple layered prestige systems like in realm grinder or so   even though some players and guides might let it seem like rocketscience at first glance  it aint  its fairly simple actually  just keep in mind that gold is always king and youre good  the biggest pro is the community chat though    the game itself isnt reinventing the whole genre  but it is going a long way for its genre to implement the community and  multiplayer  aspects    because of that i let the  rpg  slip in the name of an idle game  all this guild and pvp stuff is giving it a bit the impression of one  during my time playing i heard it often that many players are just there for the chat  its defo a pro as well that the community is not your average minecraft roblox and whatnot toxic kiddie chat  most of the time  p  due to the genre you wont find many long term players under 30  since the young folks these days have the attention span of uncle bens 2 minutes express rice   another plus is that you cant possibly mess up in this game    only exception is the warmachine part  but normally you should be aware of the mistakes to be avoided there if you follow the gamechat a bit or read a guide now to the cons  timers  for me its timers if i think back    almost every aspect is determined by timers  be it researches  guild expeditions  map missions    you name it  you get a timer  so if you want to play the most optimal way you need to be constantly online watching the timers all the time  and yes you can ofc aviod that by setting up an autoclicker if youre good with pcs    but thats not a solution for everybody  then we have the extremely slow gameplay    dont get me wrong here  at first its decently fast and feels rewarding  but as you progress further and further it slows down tremendously  so if youre not prepared for the grind from hell for years to come to get to a high level you might want to think it all over   warmachines for example    if you are far in the campaign you can determine the time by quartals to the next bit of progress  but ofc the devs are considerate of that little issue and offer ingame microtransactions to boost up your progress  so before i get to that i want to make clear that im well aware that they need some cash rolling  all fair game  youre not forced at all to pay a cent here  you can play perfectly fine and with decent progress without spending any money if youre very  very active and or use a makro script 24 7    but who does that  lolso we get offers in the ingame shop and special offers  which at first hold their promises  especially the most expensive items  the 100  packs    but that wont last long  as the concept of the game is to use up more and more resources while not really increasing your income at some point    so with a lvl 100 character you might feel like evil kniefel jumping over the grand canyon with a minibike  this will stop at around lvl 450 500  this is where the real pain begins  even a few hundert dollars wont bring you anywhere  only serioulsy whaling out would enable you to keep up a fast pace  so yeah thats not a very nice feeling  the next big con for me is the fact that the game community is in fact divided into several servers  by the time i quit we had 10 different servers for this idle game      could be very well more by now  since the frequency of new server releases picked up pace tremendously in the last 12 months  and since this is no aaa production with a playerbase in the millions you can imagine that the old servers get deserted soon after the new one launches  so they get merged  so instead of 10 single servers we had in fact 6 servers  still way too much if you ask me  which results in a disadvantage for the lower level guilds on the younger server  even though there might be good reasons to do that  in the viewpoint of a player thats to say the very least disappointing after grinding for months and years to get a huge setback due to that policy and my last con is the warmachine part distribution system  thats total bogus  so let me disclose  new players or player to be might think that you get materials for every warmachine you own  so they can be used by whatever machine    but oh no  each individual machine gets their own mats    at first that isnt a big problem  but later on this is one of the most painful mechanics in the game  you basically get punished for progress  only god knows what was going on in the mind of the game designer while deciding this    and im not even sure of that    but enough nagging from me now so all in all its not easy to find a final result here since its still in development and nobody knows how the endresult will look like one day  to sum it all up  the positive aspects  mainly the community for me personally outweights my cons  so i would recommend this game to casual players  who are there for the fun of chatting and doing some stuff in the background and have fun with forming guilds and so on  if you plan to stay f2p but are into leaderboards and pvp this will most likely be a frustrating experience  but please  try it out yourself   all in all i personally had a fun time here  the cons might sound worse than they

just buying the new updated character pack and getting to play it immediately is a good thing so  back to back comparisons  b gameplay   b different enough  combat doesn t stop you in the panel you challenged  instead you keep going  which allows a different depth of mechanics  where you will likely be attacked back since you re now ahead of the person you just fought  in general  the game is more combat oriented  as the great majority of cards targeting other players usually involve lowering their hp  while self targeting ones are more about boosting your own stats  combat will be your main source of income  as other methods of gaining currency will likely be too slow to keep up  and as a difference to 100 oj  any ranged attacks you directly target an enemy with  i will actually act as if won in combat  transferring half their coins to you  i  instead of drawing your hyper  your ability is simply a button on cooldown  which means you can always have that ace under your sleeve  plus the cooldown is usually fairly low  so using it liberally is also an option  b characters   b we have pandaman and padman  there are male characters  if that s not your style  there s z3000  a literal trashbin if characters breastily boobiling around the stage aren t your type  that s understandable  there is a  naive angel mode  in the options which alters the designs to be more conservative  so if you still want to try the game but don t want people looking at your screen think you re playing a porn game as for gameplay  they re all fairly unique in design and have their own stats  passive and skills  stats come in play mostly in combat  as they dictate your minimum roll for attack and defense  and each character plays fairly different from each other  some requiring a bit more thinking to use effectively  b boards   b in this game they re more mario party styled  each one featuring some kind of gimmick with more  random events  type of panels  plus even the coin draw panel works basically the same as mario party  they also are omnidirectional  meaning you can go in any direction you want  even switch it on the fly with the use of a card creating more boards that feel nice to play which also include some sort of gimmick is difficult  so i understand the lack of content on this side  b user experience   b probably the weakest part of the package  the options menu clashes with the rest of the style  you can t see enemy buffs debuffs  though to be fair it took oj a fair amount of time til they implemented this function too   translations are a bit iffy  you can get lost in menus even if they re not many  and while mentioned that it was being added in a later update  the lack of a card history function makes following the game a bit more difficult  i won t mention other details as they mentioned earlier as they are being worked on also  personally  i love the emoji only chat  b music   b a small section but still warranted  music is good  yes  there s a limit to how good a song can be when it s played on loop for 90  of the game  more variety would be welcome  h2 conclusion  h2  i ve been having fun with the game  despite the long match time and bugs  i would say give it some time to sort itself out and it will become a good alternative to 100  orange juice  at least one with huge

two point campus  2022  is the sophomore release from two point studios  following up their 2018 theme hospital spiritual successor  two point hospital  taking inspiration from isometric sim games of yore but this time adding a twist on it instead of mostly just reimplementing theme hospital  two point campus is a fun romp that fixes a lot of the issues with tph  while remaining bogged down by others in two point campus  you take the role as a campus administrator  responsible for hiring and firing staff and faculty  building rooms and buildings  and accepting students  the game is broken up into years  each of which takes about 20 minutes of real time  during which students will go from class to class  increasing their grades while spending time between classes to take care of their needs  this is a big difference compared to two point hospital   in tph  every patient entering your hospital started a timer to cure them before their health meter hit zero and they kicked the bucket  or were otherwise distressed enough to leave  but most of the time death was the major clock   this had a counterintuitive effect on the game   the menus were filled to the brim with all sorts of cute and fun items to please your patients  few of which you actually wanted to use because patients getting distracted just meant the gentle embrace of death grew that much nearer  tpc  on the other hand  has you stuck with your students for multiple years  and you need to keep them happy enough that they don t drop out  and smart enough that they don t flunk out in order to keep that sweet  sweet tuition and dorm rent money flowing  so while it was okay to let your patients starve in tph  in tpc that s a quick way to get a bunch of depressed teenagers dropping out  additionally  students also have their own personal goals they want to see while at college   something like seeing a concert  or getting into a relationship  or just looking at a nice hedge shaped like a duck  so you ll be placing all sorts of fun flavor items around the campus to satisfy those whims  overall  a good change and it really helps make your campus feel like a campus another good change from its predecessor is the way tpc handles rooms  in tph  you needed to build rooms to complete actions  usually either diagnosis or treatment  in place of those categories  tpc has courses which each use one or more different kinds of rooms  a student in the money wrangling program has classes in a lecture hall and a computer lab  but a student in the musicality program has classes in a lecture hall  computer lab  and a recording studio  each course has its own requirements  and savvy players may even provide courses whose rooms complement each other  helping avoid unnecessary extra construction  however  students don t just need a room   they also need that room to have certain objects within  usually requiring bigger and more expensive items in later courses  while your first year scientography students will be fine with just a science hub  your third years will need the large and expensive microscope or thunder balls in the classroom in order to keep their grades up  in tph  you almost never wanted to make a room bigger than the absolute bare minimum size allowed  with only a few limited exceptions for rooms that could operate in parallel off a single room   things like a bathroom where more stalls means more throughput  or adding beds to a trauma ward  in tpc  while you might be able to get away with a min size room for your first year or two  you ll all but need to make those rooms bigger to accommodate those extra required objects  which is great  it helps to add a lot of variety to your campuses  since i found that i was often upgrading my existing rooms instead of making a one size fits all template and plopping that down to replace the original  upgrading rooms is helped a lot by the new addition of being able to build your own buildings and resize your existing ones  too   though i would argue that  although it s undeniably super convenient  it s also kind of overpowered  since it completely short circuits one of the fun parts of tph s room layouts  which was puzzling out how to lay out your rooms  in tpc  you never need to  since you can just knock down a wall to fit a new extra meters of classroom  tpc also brought back the prestige system from tph  where rooms gain levels based on how much stuff is in them  arguably  it s even more important now   higher prestige rooms make students happier and learn better  which is why it s a shame that it s such a pain in the ass now  tph had a degenerate strategy whereby you could just spam hundreds of a single small  high prestige item to pump up your prestige rating  tpc addresses this by    adding severe diminishing returns on items you add multiples of  which is smart  at first  but realistically that means to hit the high level requirements students often want  you ll be plastering the walls of your rooms with dozens of different posters  which is a complete thematic miss and is also a usability disaster  to boot there are plenty of other changes  too  some better  some worse  training doesn t have you flying in experts  or having your staff teach a class of your colleagues anymore   they just sit in a training pod until they level up  worse  each staff member has three skill slots  each of which have ten levels   and skills no longer increase just from being used  in tph  your doctors would improve as they worked  in tpc  your staff is just as good as they were the day you hired them if you don t train them  classes are not super well balanced   i often found myself taking the same 2 3 courses in levels  since they had high tuition fees  relatively small rooms  and brought in students that had helpful passive abilities  and this is never told to you in game  but some classes can actively cause problems for you in the form of campus invasions  tpc s equivalent of tph s ghosts  whereby your janitors need a special skill in order to remove the ruffians before they cause too much chaos  or other maluses  the campaign has some good variety  and unlike tph i felt like the 3 star requirements didn t really outstay their welcome  with the worst goals usually just being  graduate so many students with this grade or better   which isn t really too burdensome if you ve been running a good campus  there are a few levels with gimmicks  sort of like duckworth upon bilge in tph  and while most people didn t like dub s gimmick  i really liked it  as i also do the gimmicks in tpc there s also some dlc  which i didn t play  just like how i didn t play the dlc for tph  maybe if it goes on sale  i ll pick it up overall  two point campus is a great improvement to the formula that two point hospital pioneered  it took me about fifty hours overall to 100  the base game  which is coincidentally almost exactly as long as it took me to 100  two point hospital too  if you re looking for an excellently made sim game  or an evolution on the fun but flawed tph formula  two point campus is a great

tactics and communication being developed by blackfoot studios a tagline this game runs with is  ground branch puts the  tactical  back in  tactical shooter    this is absolutely true gb is a no nonsense tactical shooter  no gimmicks  no cringey characters  dialogue or anything like that  there s not even a tutorial for this game  so if you wanna get into it then you re going to have to get out there and play the game  learn a thing or two from other players  look up guides or videos on youtube to teach you how to play  there is no hand holding and personally i think that is amazing  h1 story  h1 you are apart of the real world cia s ground branch  you will be tasked with performing clandestine operations  covert ops and most importantly  unconventional warfare  that last one is something you are going to have to be good at because otherwise you are not going to make it  h1 gameplay  h1 gb s gameplay loop is incredibly riveting  the firefights are exciting  the models for the guns and equipment you use are all based on real world firearms  gear and equipment  bravo to everyone involved in creating all of this to craft something  while definitely unfinished  is incredibly well oiled and functions great  the animations are all very well done and don t have problems a lot of other tactical shooters do where your operator takes forever to reload  you reload like you re in a hostile environment  not at the range with some buddies the game is super fun and has gotten almost 400 hours of playtime out of me at the time of writing this review ground branch has some of the most impressive customization i have seen in a video game ever  yeah all of the uniforms and gear you can wear is super cool as you can decide exactly what pouches you will wear on your plate carrier but what s even cooler is you can place an optic or scope  laser  flashlight  etc  almost anywhere on your gun  with limitations mind you for performance reasons  but what is there is really  really in depth and insanely modular  h1 maps   modes  h1 so where will you be using all of this equipment  this game has a handful of maps and modes  as of update v1033  there are 2 pve modes and 6 pvp modes  i can t go into depth about every mode as that would make this review even longer but pve is 100  this game s bread and butter pvp is very good  free for all on the airplane level with shotguns only was some of the most fun i ve had in pvp speaking of levels  let s talk about them there are about 14 or so maps in the game  some of them still have that  early access  feel but as of update v1033 the devs are overhauling the visuals of most of their maps to bring them up to 2023 standards and they ve done an awesome job at that so far with the recent depot and storage facility changes  h1 my criticisms  h1 ground branch is still in early access and is being worked on by a small dev team so much of what i am going to talk about is subject to change  being worked on or will be added in the future  where to begin    i guess the lack of variety would be a good place to start  u  b  i lack of variety  i   b   u    i am exaggerating a little but gb has an awesome variety of weapons in all of its categories but many of its weapons are very similar in functionality or are the same weapon platform but with a different model  for example  the assault rifles category has 14 weapons  7 of which are ak platform rifles and the other 7 are ar 15 platform rifles  all of these guns do have many differences and some minutiae but they all perform the exact same in game for the most part with the exception of the m16a4 as that rifle is big and doesn t have full auto capability but rather a 3 round burst firemode instead submachine guns has 7 weapons  4 of which are different variants of the mp5 i want to reiterate that this game has really good variety but these two weapon categories definitely need some revision  in the future the devs will be adding in the ability to change the stocks  handguards and barrel lengths so many of these weapons will be consolidated into one as many of the differences in game right now between them are just their barrel lengths  u  b  i the ai  i   b   u     the ai in this game isn t amazing by any means but they can range from doing occasionally smart things like moving together  flanking and overwhelming the player but they will also do incredibly dumb things like standing out in the open while being shot at  not reacting to dead bodies  unless they see their comrade die infront of them  among other problems     u  b  i no real lore  i   b   u    i love lore  always been a stickler for it but there s none of it in this game and i hope when blackfoot adds in the  campaign  missions that they will give us an interesting reason why we re doing the things we do beyond  there s terrorists in the city forest abandoned school underground storage facility etc   i don t like to compare video games often in my reviews but the the games ground branch takes inspiration from have lots of lore and environmental storytelling  hopefully we will get some of this in the future  u  b  i speed   movement  i   b   u     i ve done some testing and found out a while back that the encumberance system doesn t actually slow down the player but only affects the arm strength of your character  while this isn t a problem for most people but it should be punishing people who pack their plate carriers with lmg ammo all over and just run around like it isn t a tactical shooter  another thing i d like to mention is the movement in general  while it s serviceable it doesn t have any inertia or weight to it i just feel like a floating object  not a human being  i think the lack of locomotion with a sense of weight is what s currently missing  u  b  i no armor  i   b   u     this is something that really tarnishes my experience at times  gb has been in development for well over 10 years now and there is still no armor system put in place at all  all the helmets and plate carriers in this game are totally cosmetic and don t actually protect you  paired with the slippery ai this can make for some frustrating moments where they snipe you while you have zero ways to protect yourself besides spotting the threat first which isn t always the case while i have a lot to criticize this game about  i am happy to report that a lot of the problems i have mentioned above are featured on this game s roadmap and are going to  introduce their first pass be fixed overhauled entirely and that s right  blackfoot studios have a roadmap containing most of the things they are currently working on  planned features  etc  url https   trello com b bdkxegf5 ground branch roadmap here s the gb roadmap in case you d like to check it out here   url  h1 final words  h1 would i recommend this game  yes absolutely  grab a couple of friends and play this game with them or play on the community servers and you will definitely have a good time the game is about to hit its full release in the near future and will be out of early access so grab the game now while you can because once it s out of early access  the price will go up ground branch is truly a special video game  it s worked on by very passionate developers who interact with their communtiy regularly while only trying to appeal to that specific community and while it has definitely made them incredibly niche  they have a very loyal fanbase that will keep supporting them and that is something a lot of devs wish for and that is truly incredible thanks for

future to reflect new developments   b  review updated  november 2022  b   b  u opening thoughts   u   b i consider myself an avid player of music and rhythm games  and have played several over the years  across many different platforms  including the hatsune miku series  ps3  ps4  steam   muse dash  steam   deemo  ps4 version   ia vt colorful  vita  and the djmax series  vita  ps4   steam  to name just a few  having said that  sixtar gate  startrail has been the first rhythm game i ve played using a keyboard  as i prefer to use a controller when possible  so  in a way  this was a completely fresh experience for me that i ve enjoyed immensely  of the games listed  sixtar gate is most like djmax  but  the unique twist of the player opening a  gate  to add an extra key to a 4 button or 6 button mode during the song  turning it into a 5 button or 7 button mode  makes the gameplay feel new  and  while both this game and djmax certainly have a difficulty curve where you may need to practice a fair bit to be successful  sixtar gate benefits from a curve that is gradual and intuitive  if you start with the easy mode  comet  version of the songs  start on level 1 and work your way up  you will see your reaction times and the difficulty of the songs increase at a similar rate  eventually  those harder songs you thought you would never be able to play through  will seem readable and you will complete them with ease  if you re not familiar with rhythm games or playing such games with a keyboard though  don t be surprised if you struggle if you jump right to normal mode  nova  or hard mode  super nova  instead   b  u current gameplay modes   u   b with all that being said  despite the game still being in  early access  there are a few different gameplay modes players can engage in at this time  with a strong song list that is frequently being updated  b unity quest   b  this is the traditional multiplayer online mode  i personally do not enjoy multiplayer in rhythm games  but  for those that do  you can have a private match with others  or complete challenges  the challenges are in beta mode  at the moment  as far as i m aware   there are also in game emoticons you can purchase with the in game currency  via the in game shop  that come into play here   b travel quest   b  this is what you would typically expect from a  freestyle  mode  you can play any of your unlocked songs at  the difficulty level of your choice  by completing songs  you will earn some of the in game currency  which you can then use to unlock further songs  emoticons  and profile items at the in game store  press the spacebar at the song selection screen to bring up a sub menu to the store  your inventory  standby  settings  etc    in game currency is also given to players as a daily log in reward  at this time  the reward resets at the beginning of the month if you feel like you want to change the button layouts to better fit your gameplay or modify the sound output  you have options to do so in the settings menu  you can also change how the ui looks during a song via the standby menu  and add things like a combo counter or a high score tracker  among others as of  b november 2022  b   the developers have added a passive multiplayer option to travel quests  during these  b unity sessions  b   which you  activate  by pressing f5 on your keyboard  you will still get to play any song at the difficulty level of your choice  but  other players will be able to view your chosen song s title and score as you play  along with your profile card  similarly  you will also see other players  information along the sides of your screen  this set up does not hinder your ability to read or play your chosen song  which is great  however  gameplay wise  there are no additional benefits to playing in unity sessions at this time  outside of participating in the mode for an achievement  but  with that being said  it will be interesting to see if the developers make changes to this in the future       b lesson   b  this is currently a brief gameplay tutorial  though it does look like the developers will be adding more to this in the future   b license test   b  this is most like djmax s mission mode or are a skills test of sorts  here  you play sets of 3 songs  both the songs and difficulty are pre determined  in order to earn licenses  at this point in time  this is the one mode that seems to be more for experienced players as the easiest license still has moderate to difficult normal songs  nova mode  and a hard mode song  super nova  to complete in order to pass  i hope that  in the future  the developers consider implementing a lower license level than the junior mode  the first license test of which i ve described above   the game would benefit from having a  cadet  like license that has a combination of easy mode  comet  songs for beginner players to complete  this would make all aspects of the game welcoming to beginners   be beginner friendly  besides the gameplay modes   types i ve described above  it does seem like there are future modes in development  too  which will be exciting to see   b  u tldr   u   b overall  i would definitely recommend this game to both avid rhythm gamers and those interested in trying out the genre  with a constantly expanding free song list and gameplay  as well as great dlc packs  it s a fantastic way to ease into something similar to djmax without feeling intimidated  and gradually grow your skills and confidence without hurting your wallet  plus  the 4 5 and 6 7 button modes that change via the  gate  feature will keep you on your toes and make the gameplay feel new  so  what are you waiting for  join the lovable mascot shii and set sail as you become the captain of your rhythm game experience in sixtar gate  startrail",2022-07-01,2022-11-29,True,9,0,0.627078533172607422,0,True,False,True

questionably aged characters with perhaps more questionable costumes  if you re here for the art style  what you see is what you get  cute chibi pixel sprites for most of the game  portraits of cute girls in cutscenes and dialogue  occasionally cg of a little bit more  no actual ero though   if you re here for the gameplay  you re in the right place  because rabi ribi feels absolutely amazing to play movement in rabi ribi feels basic at first  your character snaps directions instantly giving you full control and you get the typical items as you explore that make progression faster  dash  wall jump  etc  but you ll quickly come to discover that erina  our bunny girl  has tons of techniques available right from the beginning that the game never tells you about  you can wall jump without the item with precise timing  you can springboard off walls for some insane sequence breaks  the game is beatable with 0  item completion   most fun  you can quick fall from the apex of your jump for a burst of movement forwards and down  it s so fun to loop and honestly the only thing i could compare it to is a melee wavedash  movement tech with items consumes stamina  which regenerates when not being used  this might seem limiting at first  but you have such a variety of ways to zip around the map that finding fast stamina neutral movement is honestly so fun in and of itself metroidvanias  and to a larger extent all non linear games  have the issue of managing difficulty with player progression  rabi ribi allows you to tackle its massive roster of  25 unique bosses  which in a very cute themeing choice are all townspeople you can recruit upon beating them  in almost any order  with bosses having a certain level based on your story and item progression when you meet them  what makes this especially ingenious is that higher levels does not just mean more health and damage  but also unlocks new patterns that become progressively more difficult to dodge  sometimes requiring movement tech specific to a certain item  while the player is expected to do the bosses closer to town first  you can technically travel around the map completely freely and still have a difficulty curve that feels completely natural  overworld travelling is a lot more about navigating around spikes and platforms instead of fighting enemies  so mobs on the overworld don t play into this difficulty curve too much combat in rabi ribi is one of the most enthralling video game experiences  it pulls the bullet hell trick  where your character s hurtbox is tiny  making you feel like a god as you weave back and forth between thousands of bright lights and beams that go clean through your character s legs  but by adding gravity and changing the plane on which the game is played  the challenges increase  and you feel so much more skilled than any typical bullet hell  ribbon  erina s fairy friend  gives you a ranged attack that can  and should  be charged at all times  and released completely independently of erina s actions  this always gives you something to manage  and lends to a bit of a more typical bullet hell experience  taking potshots while you sit back at a distance so you have more time to react to the enemy s light show  but the real star here is when you close in for big melee damage with erina  erina s hammer has an auto combo which can be mashed for decent damage  but the real fun is that most of your skills can be cancelled into one another  provided you have the stamina for it  and with some help from ribbon  bosses can be kept in hitstun for quite lengthy periods of time  effectively turning every one of your openings into a fighting game freestyle combo  i can t stress enough how freestyle the combat is for this kind of game  it seems like every main item you pick up has uses  not only for exploration  not only for movement  but also has 5 different uses within a fight  either on offense to extend your attack or on defense to help you dodge  rabi ribi s items really are some of the most exciting pick ups i can think of across all the metroidvanias i ve played  the shining jewel of these items  the standout for multifaceted item usage  and probably my favourite video game item ever is the bunny amulet  erina s bunny amulet is a pretty early item that has multiple charges and gives brief invincibility when used  it s immediate value to the player is when you reach an  oh sh t  moment  where you ve positioned yourself poorly in a fight or you are met with a new attack that you have no clue how to dodge  it can also be used in the overworld to cheese some otherwise difficult platforming sections  this puts the item in the unique position where it is not ever necessary  but is probably the most valuable item in the game as it lowers the execution demands from the player considerably for any fight  by allowing them to make more mistakes  as you become more familiar with game mechanics though  you ll notice the amulet releases a wave that stuns enemies for a very short duration when used  which can give you an opportunity to attack if you ve already closed in considerably on the enemy  the coolest feature of the bunny amulet though  is that it resets your stamina bar if not empty  giving you more juice to combo the boss with  every charge of the amulet is so interesting since you have to decide whether to save it for a defensive use or spend it to squeeze out some more damage while you can  on top of this your combos on bosses need to be carefully managed to not fully deplete your stamina bar  which doesn t allow for the reset   but you can t rely on having the same amount of stamina every time since you don t know how much you ll need to spend to close the distance between you and the opponent  the amount of active  on the fly decisions you make  even subconsciously  during combat in this game is wild to me  all while dodging a barrage of bullets at lightning speed  this erratic combat during boss fights is what makes rabi ribi truly such an incredible game  and i don t think there s another single player game out there that replicates this  rabi ribi s story is worse than the average good game  but better than the average good anime game  there are exactly two  2  characters who s personality would take more than one sentence to describe  the girls are all very likeable  and there s a little bit of an emotional arc near the ending and in the post game and dlc  but i won t pretend like the game s saying something profound here the music is mostly forgettable  but perfectly pleasant   i speicher galerie  i  is the only track i d say really sticks out  with its heavy  somber piano chords that are atypical to the bubbly electronic tone of the rest of the game  it makes for a perfect ambiance in the area leading up to the end of the game  and the last and best fight i hope i ve managed to explain a little bit about what makes rabi ribi so special to me  i played this game for the first time 7 years ago  played it most recently 3 years ago  and it still lives in my head  i ve never met anyone else who has played it  so i finally took the steam comments after so long to gush about it for way too many words  if you re not weirded out by the artstyle  and especially if you re a weeb who enjoys it   i implore you to explore what i think are some of the greatest battles video games have to offer",2023-08-25,2023-08-25,True,46,2,0.787001192569732666,1,True,False,False

game  to be honest  the screen shots for the game look way better than any moment i ever had while playing the game  i don t know what method they used to make it look so good  tidy things up  and add things in  but it is not representative of the final product the game itself is very ugly and bare bones  the different towns are sparsely decorated  trees and bushes and pretty much every asset is constantly reused  everywhere  inside  and outside  there is rarely anything unique  other than the very few unique items to hunt and sell  the character models are just ugly  though the items inside the homes do look nice while not a lot of effort went into making the game world look good  the house designs layouts are alright  almost none of them repeat  only a few here and there  most of the development time for this game seems to have gone in two places  house design  and the car dismemberment mechanics  there is more to disassembling a car than there is to picking locks levels one through three  disassembling jewelry  unlocking electronic devices  hot wiring cars  disabling alarms  and hacking  all of those things are extremely simple  which is a real shame  disassembling jewelry could have also been quite a good and fun mini game  but it is just point and click  either make it all fun and interesting  or don t make it take 30 minutes to fully disassemble a car but yeah  the house designs are well laid out  tenant  and later guard  rotations are    interesting  and change for each home you visit  however  it doesn t make much sense a lot of the time  where and when do some of these people sleep  they don t have that in their schedule  why does a whole family sleep during the day  why do some people never leave their home  ever  i can see they wanted different routines for each house  but it lacks realism  also  i have never seen so many people walking in a neighborhood in my life  both the upper class one  and the lower class one  and at night too  more people are walking around than live in both areas combined it feels like some people were assigned tasks  and none of them talked to each other   you design the environments and people outside  you design the homes  you design the people inside and their schedules  you design what loot is inside the house   and so forth  that  or everything was all done in stages that didn t line up  because a lot of the time  some of it does not mesh well  at all  some homes  in order to actually loot the large items in them  you need to rely on exploits like throwing things out windows and over fences  when it is clearly not designed to do that   though honestly it should  why can t i pass paintings and flat screen tvs through fences  why can t i set up areas to lower items down  some places you have to use your car as a makeshift ramp to jump over properties  because the only way in and out is a single electronic door you cannot re lock behind you that the tenants will see when they either leave or come home  and you do not have enough time to loot even a single item  because of the guard rotations  some of it is just madness what you are expected to do  or how long you have to wait in closets  or how many times you have to go back in and wait in closets in a single heist if you could have time fast forward while in a closet  like you do while in your car in parking spots  that would be extremely helpful and way less time consuming  the fact that you can only pass time in your car in designated locations is also annoying  another annoyance is that button prompts don t like coming up  especially for climbing windows or up pipes  when waiting and passing time in your car  there is no button to just start it up and drive  you have to exit your car  and get back in  there are so many little inconveniences like this that make the game annoying to play at times unfortunately leveling up and getting skills does not make the game easier  or more fun  as you progress from poor neighborhoods and houses  to rich ones  you need more complicated gear and more complex methods to get in and out  the skill system and progression isn t there to make the game more fun  it is there to level lock you so you can t instantly go and rob rich people  which is a shame  if you can rely on your crowbar and your wits and still rob a heavily guarded home  that should be allowed  also there is really no use to money other than buying more expensive gear to go with your new skills i did enjoy parts of this game though  there is just something about marking down the routines of the people on the property  finding cameras  making your way through all of the security  exploring the house and planning your routes  it is fun game play  despite the game doing quite a lot to try and not make it fun by accident i think that is the perfect note to end on  this game is still fun  despite the many  many problems and issues that plague it  if you think you will have fun with this game  then i guess go for it  but  get it on sale  this does not feel like a  25 game with all of the bugs and issues  it regularly goes on sale for  85  off  get it then if you are going to get it at

if you ve seen  watched  or played any zombie related game with a run down town  you know exactly what this game is offering graphically  nott bad  just could ve used a bit of flair   b story   b  the story in this game was pretty average  not bad  but certainly didn t have the weight of the tv show  for example  each character you only meet a few times at most  and only very briefly  i didn t feel like we really got to connect with anyone enough to make a meaningful impact  talking over the radio to someone  finding notes that read aloud in the author s voice  these things weren t enough on their own to build character  again  there was nothing outright bad  it just fell short  a few times when talking to casey over the radio  the conversations really felt scripted  which they of course are  but you don t want it to feel that way  you know  b gameplay   b  the actual killing of zombies in this game is so damn good though  from smashing a glass bottle on a zombie s head and then stabbing the broken bottle into their face  to using a cleaver to hack right into their skull  to using a sword  had an absolute fanboy moment over the sword  good gravy  to decapitate the zombies this is absolutely where this game shines  you can really play however you like and do whatever cool and stupid things come to mind  so while i loved me a good ol regular katana  my brain asked the question   do you think you can dual wield katanas and spin around so you become a katana copter of death in the middle of a crowd of zombies   the answer  my dear reader  is yes  and it  was  glorious looting was enjoyable  and the fact that the loot wasn t the same when you go back to an area was good too  initially i just wanted to take everything that wasn t nailed down  but alas  backpack space  so  you make sure to check what recipes and upgrades you want to work on and see what ingredients they need and loot accordingly  once you get your haul back to your base  the recycling bin  although a very basic idea  was flawless  you just toss your junk in there  and whatever resources were in that item get sent to your salvage inventory  this was satisfying crafting was basic  but it worked  the game magically spawns an item in when you have the required resources and you interact with a crafting recipe at your benches  this is fine  but in a vr game i would have liked a little more of a hands on approach to crafting also would have been cool to be able to repair our stuff the saving system really needed to be better  the only thing that saves your game is travelling to a different area and drinking out of the flask  i did the first mission 4 times because of crashes and losing all my progress  for the love of cheese  every game needs to have a manual save system  or a frequent auto save system  or both  as someone who likes to clear areas before looting  the respawning zombies drove me nuts early on  they respawn behind you in an area you ve cleared or sometimes they even respawn in front of you  on one hand  i get it  to keep the suspense there  to make us make rushed decisions about what to take because another zombie just shambled into the room we were looting i m sure these are the reasons that respawning is a thing  on the other hand  as a game that had so much loot  and you need it  too  all those upgrades must be crafted   i just wanted to clear an area of zombies  take my time and loot the ever loving sh   out of it  the workaround for this is to just cover yourself in zombie guts  at least then you can loot in relative peace and get occasional compliments on your intestinal attire from the locals controls were just okay  i had issues with the  tele grab  function more than a handful of times  waving my hands like an idiot  standing right next to something trying to get the pickup circle to appear  sometimes it worked great  sometimes it didn t  gun sights and shooting felt a little odd  i m no vr pro  but i m usually decent at fps mechanics in vr  and something about this didn t feel right  i would have the iron sights lined up perfectly and still my shots would miss when i was more than 20 meters away  the bow had a weird aim assist on the arrows  too  i fully understand most people would probably be a terrible shot with a bow without it  me included  but it just needed a bit more polish  i feel like the controls in general could have used a bit more fine tuning  b bugs   b  the first issue i had was that pressing the menu button on my hp reverb g2 controllers just black screened the game  i found out that changing controls schemes to a community made one fixed it then there were the audio related crashes  for some reason or another  your game will crash  and then when you try to open the game again  it will crash immediately upon opening  some poking around on the forums revealed that  for whatever reason  certain audio causes the crash  and the workaround is to change your output device to something that isn t your headset while the game loads  and then switch back once it s loaded properly i had at least 10  i stopped counting once i knew it was going to keep happening  crashes related to killing zombies  again  forum posts showed that this is a long standing bug that has to do with using blunt objects  i was using a skull  but people have reported all kinds of blunt objects causing it  to kill zombies  it took me 5 minutes tops of searching the steam forums to see that this was reported back in 2020  who knows why the devs haven t fixed this one i also had numerous crashes related to an  access violation error  according to the crash reporter in unreal engine  unsure if this is specifically related to this game  or my headset or even windows 11  kinda hard to say when you re only given so much information to go off the majority of the time  the game wouldn t even load on the first go  i d try launching it from steamvr and it would try to load  but it would either go back to steamvr or just crash  usually after a crash  it will load fine the next time  usually  b final thoughts   b  i m still unsure whether it was the game at fault for all the crashes  or my hardware software  and i won t ever know  but i can only go off the experience i had  and boy was it frustrating dealing with crashes every single time i played this game  coupled with the very limited save system  this made for a lot of lost hours and bad first impressions  what i will say is that the reason i wanted to play this game was the zombie killing and that was a buttload of fun  the story and characters might have been pretty average  but the fun factor was definitely up there  i hope the studio has learned from this game and will make an even better experience in their next title  b do i recommend this game   b  yes  on sale",2023-09-17,2023-09-17,True,54,2,0.754168272018432617,2,False,False,False

shouldn t need more than 40 hours to finish it  you will have fun most of that time  except for the times when you re busy rolling your eyes and cringing  if your english is good enough  play the main game in english  even if your main language happens to be closer to russian  but  if your russian is good enough  play the leia dlc in russian  it is really worth it details  i played this game twice  once in english  and once in russian because i needed to figure some things out  see below  good things first as a space survival game  it is very good  the story is fun  and the setting is a mixture of beautiful and horrifying in equal measure  the atmosphere is a nice change from the sameness of the western aesthetic  it is mildly pseudo soviet futurist  more to that later  the dlc  which is unrelated to the main story and characters  goes even more into the survival and horror aspect  and is highly recommended  but stressfull   it lacks the humoristic aspect of the main game  which you might consider fortunate  see below   the russian voice over of the dlc is fantastic  the experiment overseer is exactly the type of clinically detached secretary   government official that you ll meet at the russian embassy if you have the dubious pleasure to  say  require a visa  unfortunately  this gets lost in the english dub  so if your russian is good enough  play the dlc  and only the dlc  in russian from technical perspective  this is a  really  well made space survival game  it has practically no bugs  which is astounding for a modern game  and there is no way to get stuck that i could find  it is well balanced  hard enough to be challenging but not so hard as to be frustrating   it has a really nice base building component  that is entirely optional and i managed to miss it completely on my first playthrough  but it makes your life a lot easier if you do it at the right time   many things can be solved in more than one way  there is only one area where you actually  need  a blaster  and i am not sure what happens there if you don t have one  the  meh  the aesthetic and some of the setting look as an attempt at critical soviet futurism  unfortunately  it comes off as an odd westernized parody on russian soviet aesthetic rather than the real thing  it is hard to tell if it is on purpose  as the game is intended  to be of humorous nature   more on that later  if you play the main game in english  you get the idea that this is somebody from the west who is trying to imitate the soviet look and feel  there is even a song running on the  radio  that is a russian song sung by somebody who is clearly not russian and who clearly doesn t understand what he is singing  but is simply trying to reproduce the sounds and sometimes failing  this weirdness is highlighted by the extremely enthusiastic american insurance salesman tone of your space suit and its messages however  you ll come to miss the insurance salesman version if you ever switch to russian because if you play it in russian  it gets even more confusing  on one hand  it comes off a lot more genuine in many ways     but a few of the jokes seem to be reverse translated from english  political humor that was ubiquitous in the su is almost entirely absent  low brow humor  that was largely absent in the su  is ubiquitous  and the russian voice overs are of a moderately low quality  my suspicion towards the end was that the devs couldn t find voice actors and did the voice over themselves  whereas they managed to find actual voice actors for the english version and for the dlc    but who knows towards the end of my english playthrough i was wondering if the devs were kids of russian immigrants  by the end of my russian playthrough i was sure that they weren t  see below   but was wondering if the dev team just didn t have anyone in close proximity who is old enough to have witnessed the real thing  and are recreating the pseudosoviet aesthetic basically as culture archaeologists   from fragments in the surroundings and from hearsay to sum it up  the most actually soviet russian thing in this game are the murals  very nicely executed    and the copious amounts of the blue insulation tape on literally everything you build  this is what most of things in the soviet union were held together by   that  and copper wire  one other thing is that the suit talks way too much   i am not sure if playing this in the hardcore mode would fix this  as it says  no hints   but having spent way too much time on the game already i prefer not to try  yes  it is a necessary setup for some jokes  you need to get used to it explaining things in order to notice that sometimes the explanations are painfully wrong   but occasionally you d like to have some time to  decode  the scene yourself before it starts talking  and in some cases  some particularly confusing ones   it stays silent  part of the joke the bad and the ugly some of the humor  thankfully absent in the dlc as it wouldn t fit the tone  is deeply  unsettlingly cringe  the english version defuses a particularly nasty movie title  and makes the diagnosis station somewhat more palatable  maybe that type

developing since the early 2000s having worked with a number of developers over the years  i ve only just recently picked up automobilista 2 however and never played the original  why is that  well i ve been more into pure sims such as rfactor  rfactor 2 and iracing to care for much else but recently i branched out and decided  what the heck  i ll give it a try because i keep hearing it has the best offline single player ai in any game  so here goes with the review automobilista 2 surprised me  i went into it expecting to be disappointed and while i was in some area that i ll explain later in this review  for the most part  i was pleasantly surprised content  the amount of cars in the default game without having to buy any dlc is phenomenal  the best offering of different series and era and car types for a racing game of it s genre  even track wise you get a large variety that allows you to experience each of the cars in a wide variety of tracks that fit their category race championship setup options  the options you are given access to to set up a race from having practice  qualifying  race 1 and race 2 are well thought out and done very well  the championship creation setup however needs some additional work and options  not being able to create your own points system is a bit of a let down and a strange option to not include considering how much more other stuff is editable  i would say that is my only gripe about setting up a championship  having to use one of the pre existing points systems physics  the physics are very good  not pure sim like rfactor 2 or iracing but it comes very close and i think i kinda prefer this more as pure sim games have become far too advanced nowadays to be enjoyable for the common gamer which leaves the games in a state of low player base  low online attendance and even bad online experiences with amateur simmers  ams2 provides a great level of sim physics with he ability to catch the car and correct your errors  to feel when you re about to lose control etc  it s very well balanced out ai  i have seen people have mixed experiences with ai but for my experiences  the ai for single player have been the best i ve seen in any game albeit a few hurdles that still need to be fixed  1  ai are real bad on their fast lap  real slow  and sometimes that doesn t correct itself perfectly  this can happen in the races too where there will be certain corners that the ai will be overly slow even at 120 ai strength which is the max it can go  2  sometimes ai spatial awareness can be bad  most times it s fine but you ll get that one off here and there where the ai will just turn in on you or punt you from behind  now that could be realism as it doesn t happen often  but can be frustrating when it does  3  ai sometimes drive in the wet with the same grip they would have in the dry  it s not often  but one thing that is consistent in the wet is that the ai seem to have far more traction than the player does sounds  for my liking  the sounds are amazing  i like them a lot  but having been deaf three times in my life  i may not be the best judge on that  i do enjoy the sounds though and being able to hear an opponents engine as they are pulling up beside me from either side is great to help with my own spatial awareness modding  this is where ams2 is a disappointment which is a surprise considering renato started in modding  it s like a big finger was given to modders here  you can only add a skin by replacing an existing car skin  you cannot add another skin to a type of car to have an extra team in that series  i hope this changes because that is stupidly crazy  car models have been given id s for whatever stupid reason they can come up with and each car type has been given a limited number of slots which serve for the skins liveries ai drivers that will be permissable under that car model type  this limits the game so much  even trying to replicate a specific season that had more drivers teams than what is allowed in game for that car type is just silly  come on reiza  you can do better than that  this game could be huge  the biggest out there if you just opened up modding more controller ffb  for me using the thrustmaster ts xw sparco racer pc steering wheel  the game is perfect  in fact  i love the ffb on it  of course depending what steering wheel system you use  it can require some setting up to get it perfect for you  in regards to handheld controllers like an xbox controller  you can get it to work very well but it takes time and adjusting  i ve been able to get mine set up to a level where i can race like most other console games and still win races  but it took me hours to get it perfect  testing  adjusting  testing  but that s not a game issue  that s just what you have to do as a player dlcs  the dlc s that have been released are worth buying  all of them  even if you don t like the genres  branch out and try them out  you ll be pleasantly surprised  and if it helps reiza get more funds in to keep expanding on this game  then that alone is worth it in my books overall  automobilista 2 was a great susprise  i wasn t expecting to be surprised in the way i was  overall the game is worth buying and having part of your sim racing racing collection  the initial car offering is spectacular to say the least as are the tracks  the only negative i have is that modding needs to be done better  ams2 could become the pinnacle of racing games but fails to capitalise because of the way they ve set up their game  maybe this can change in the future if you love racing games with lots of different variety of racing genres  eras  etc  ams2 is for you  definitely worth trying  i will be doing career and other race videos on my twitch channel and youtube channel with the same name i use on steam so keep an eye out as they will begin taking place in march april

of raw  unadulterated action  this may even be a good choice considering the total runtime  the locations and environments are mostly inspired by rural china  in the same way  some enemies are as well  in the mythological aspect  each area is rich in detail  delivering graphics you could expect from top tier aaa titles  with great optimization on top of that  despite the amazing looks  no location really feels iconic or distinct  but instead they feel generic  serving as little more than containers for the enemies and bosses   h3 exploration   secrets  h3 each stage is linear  with regular one

just slightly branching out from the main path   don t expect wholly standalone side areas or optional open areas  taking extra time to look for skill points  special ammo and the occasional new weapon is definitely worth your time  as only in that way you ll gain enough skill points to have a varied roster of abilities later on  don t worry about getting lost or orientating  the levels are linear and streamlined enough so that this doesn t become a problem at all  h3 combat system   bosses  h3 the combat system of bmi plays out in a fast paced way  having you alternate not only four different guns with normal and special fire modes  but also several active skills for your sword and power gauntlet  other than being able to jump  sprint and dodge frequently  fights are usually against a handful of enemies that however  save for the basic weak grunts  are all to be considered a threat  and have unique movesets and behaviors each  you ll be able to adapt to the playstyle you prefer based on your skill choices  but generally all options are viable  stay at a distance and destroy your enemies with a rain of bullets   which will take longer  but is also the safest way   or go into the fray and use melee  energy push   pull and the parry system to perform high risk  high reward combos that can annihilate enemies quickly  tougher enemies have shields in addition to normal health  and they need to be destroyed with attacks or parries in order to deal full damage and render them susceptible to control effects like slow  pushback and so on  one of the main issues of the combat system is that you can block indefinitely without any stamina or limit to this mechanic   90  of all attacks can harmlessly bounce off your sword  even if there are some exceptions to the rule  mostly with bosses  given that hp auto regens  you can just kite foes around while blocking and regain hp easily  bosses don t have evolving phases  but are generally varied enough in movesets to  be interesting to fight  even if some can become quite trivial with the right skills  i m looking at you  tian yu emperor  getting perma staggered by blade skills   but still they re interesting and unique enough   h3 character progression  h3 you ll be able to gain skill points by either finding them  reliquaries  or by collecting blue orbs from the enemies and breakable objects in the environment  ten orbs is one reliquary  as in one skill point  there s not enough to unlock all skills  so you ll have to focus on what you prefer and think is best  from aoe to single target specific skills  the blade and gauntlet powers will enable you to deliver devastating attacks from a distance  with additional effects like damage over time  auto tracking and

the game     h1 introduction  h1 hey  have you tried bright memory infinite yet  it s a pretty cool game with many exciting tricks to master  this short title is a fantastic fps title with gorgeous graphics  intense combat  and fast paced gameplay  there are meaningful upgrades that are easy to come by and fun weapons to devastate your foes  h1  control and gameplay   h1 one of the tricks i ve found is that you can block with your sword while reloading to cancel the animation  that can be helpful in combat situations where you need to reload quickly but also when you want to defend yourself or cancel an action to adapt  it s just one of the many little tips and tricks you can discover in this game that elevate the gameplay as you find tactics that can deal effectively with enemies  such as riot shield agents or golem warriors the game provides you with an array of thrilling weapons to utilize  the secret to what makes them so exciting is the secondary ammo that changes how the gun behaves  which can go from sniper rifles with explosive darts to assault rifles with bullets that bend mid air towards the enemy or pistol packing a big explosion  these effects make these weapons a game changer in combat situations and immensely enjoyable to employ  you can lay enemies to burn in the fire with the shotgun s incendiary ammo  and it will feel fabulous every single time https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2970237165the boss fights are a bit easier than expected  but they are a captivating spectacle as they are impressive and intense  an example can be an ancient warrior who resembles sun wukoing  wielding blazing fire and skillfully navigating through ledges and rooftops as he ambushes you from your blind spot  regular enemies are even more pressing  as you can find yourself against a wall with the wrong strategy or weapon against a foe and perish in seconds  h1  graphics  h1 the game was tested with an rtx 2060  36 gb of ram  intel core i7 11700k   core i7 11th gen rocket lake 8 core 3 6 ghz lga 1200  i ran it at high settings with 72 fps overall the best part of the game is the gameplay and the graphics  as bright memory infinite is a visually stunning game that will blow you away with its gorgeous visuals  from breathtaking landscapes to intricate character design  every detail is meticulously crafted  the graphics make the situations in the story even more spectacular yet absurd in a good way  as you can be fighting enemies on top of a crashing plane about to be swallowed by a black hole  https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2970237032you also get panoramic views of the main protagonist sheila occasionally because of  reasons   her design is striking and elegant  h1  sound  h1 guns have a good amount of kick in the sound department  packing in the heat from the secondary and primary ammo versions  the voice acting is excellent  as it manages to hit the character s personalities well enough  although  at times  it can be stiff  the effects  such as the sword blocking and deflecting bullets  are particularly satisfying to the ears  the sound effects are also quite good for action scenes and boss fights  resulting in greater immersion  h1  highlights   h1 i enjoyed the platforming sections of bright memory infinite more than i thought i would  these feature a mix of reacting quickly or carefully planning how to reach that next section to keep moving  in addition  more challenging jumps and terrain can be traversed to find upgrades for your weapons and skills https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2970236898there is also an effort for a short game regarding variety  sheila finds herself in situations where the player has to drive a car in a wild chase  use stealth to survive enemy forces as aircraft patrol the sky and fight giant enemies flying into the atmosphere  i was impressed that the developer went out of their way to code all these features and gameplay segments for a title that lasted so little in the main run  h1  replayability   h1 the game s replayability could be better  as there is only a story mode that you can finish in about 2 3 hours  after all  the only reason to replay the game is to beat it with more significant difficulties  it leaves something to be desired  for it is criminal that a game so good doesn t last more  and i would be happy to pay more if there was more content to the game   h1  conclusion  h1 i recommend bright memory infinite to everyone that likes action games  it is a fantastic title that showcases beautiful graphics with intense fulfilling combat that requires a tactful approach at its core  the only bad thing about this title is that it is too short  like when you are eating your favorite snack and finishing all of it before being sated  9 10  amazingif you enjoy and find the review helpful  please follow my curator starsdeck  https   store steampowered com curator

chaos weapons you will have to get the skill transfiguration then beat the game only then you can go back to chapter select to be able to pick them up in chapter 3 i spent probably more than 15 mins trying to figure out how to get the first weapon  the game doesn t give you any hint that it wouldn t be possible in chapter 2 where you basically learn how to fight the game doesn t tell you that if you press c you teleport to enemies so it s easier to kill them    when using transfiguration with bloodthirsty for some reason i have issues controlling it  i can t go where i want to go or fight with it properly even when i have a lock target on so i don t know if i am the only one having this issue   new game  is also unclear  you just need to beat the game then go back to main menu and choose another difficulty you will still have your skills weapon armour also you don t need to beat the secret boss to get to newgame      many untranslated text still   the steam deck version has issues so i wouldn t recommend playing on it the positive side    beautiful music and visuals   the story isn t bad a bit of a d j  vu   different and nice mini games  spoiler     a part from killing the mice      spoiler   choices and upgrades with weapons spells combat technique   different game modes   difficulty settings   discount price  4 so i was happy with it   some free dlc you can also get extra free skin in game if you beat priestess trial mode  blood palace  survival mode  and multiplayer the skin you win in game also get damage when you fight  i think it s a nice attention to details tips    press c to teleport to enemies   you get chaos weapon only when you get the skill transfiguration beat the game first then use chapter select   if you are after the achievements there s actually a practice scene  in the menu go to play choose other mode then practice scene  so you can add all the enemies you want  instead of trying to find them per chapter select it saves atleast 2 to 3 h of grinding   you can get some free skin in game by playing different modes you need to beat priestess trial mode  blood palace  survival mode and multiplayer  or you can use mods in the workshop   if you are after the achievement master of magic you need to unlock sister li there are two versions one you get for free for completing the game which is without the staff and one you get for completing the protect sister mode in multiplayer  you can also buy the dlc for   7 but i would recommend to wait for a discount the skin should be around  2  i hope most information are useful for some of you  enjoy the game

orient s vers le combat  c est   coup s r pour vous  je vais vous donner quelques conseils car lorsque j ai commenc  le jeu  j  tais un peu perdue  le c t  n gatif  pas assez d informations  par exemple si vous voulez les armes du chaos vous devrez obtenir la comp tence transfiguration puis terminer le jeu et seulement apr s vous pourrez retourner   la s lection des chapitres pour pouvoir les r cup rer dans le chapitre 3  j ai pass  probablement plus de 15 minutes   essayer de comprendre comment obtenir la premi re arme  le jeu ne vous donne aucune indication que ce n est pas possible au d but dans le chapitre 2 o  vous apprenez   vous battre  le jeu ne vous dit pas que si vous appuyez sur c  vous vous t l portez sur les ennemis et qu il est donc plus facile de les abattre    lorsque j utilise la transfiguration avec bloodthirsty  j ai du mal   le contr ler  je ne peux pas aller o  je veux ou me battre avec lui correctement  m me quand j ai une cible verrouill e  donc je ne sais pas si je suis la seule   avoir ce probl me      newgame  n est pas clair non plus  il faut terminer le jeu puis revenir au menu principal  choisir une autre difficult   et vous aurez toujours vos comp tences armes armures  pas besoin de battre le boss secret pour acc der au newgame    beaucoup de texte non traduit   la version steam deck a des probl mes donc je ne recommanderais pas d y jouer le c t  positif     la musique et les graphismes sont attrayants   l histoire n est pas mal  un peu du d j  vu   des mini jeux diff rents et int ressants  spoiler    sauf la partie ou il faut tuer des souris     spoiler   choix dans les am liorations des armes sorts techniques de combat   diff rents modes de jeu   niveaux de difficult    prix en r duction  4 donc j  tais contente avec  a   vous pouvez  galement obtenir des skin gratuits suppl mentaires dans le jeu si vous battez le mode d essai de la pr tresse  le palais de sang  le mode survie et le mode multijoueurs  astuces    appuyez sur c pour vous t l porter vers les ennemis   vous n obtiendrez les armes du chaos que lorsque vous aurez la comp tence transfiguration  finissez le jeu puis utilisez la s lection de chapitre   il y a une section entra nement qui vous permet de r aliser presque tous les succ s qui n cessitent d abattre des mobs    dans le menu choisir jouer puis autre mode ensuite cliquer sur sc ne d entrainement  vous pouvez ajouter tous les ennemis que vous souhaitez au lieu d essayer de les trouver par s lection de chapitre   vous pouvez obtenir des skin gratuits dans le jeu en jouant   diff rents modes   vous devez battre le mode d essai de la pr tresse  le palais de sang  le mode survie et le mode multijoueurs   ou vous pouvez utiliser des mods dans le steam workshop   si vous souhaitez obtenir le titre de ma tre de la magie  vous devez d bloquer sister li  il existe deux versions   l une est gratuite si vous terminez le jeu mais c est juste le skin sans le b ton et l autre est disponible si vous terminez le mode protect sister  prot ger la soeur  en mode multijoueurs    vous pouvez  galement acheter le dlc pour  7 mais je vous recommande d attendre une r duction  le skin devrait  tre aux alentours de  2  j esp re que la plupart des informations seront utiles   certains d entre vous   bon jeu",2023-12-03,2023-12-03,True,14,0,0.693650186061859131,0,True,False,False

that found this game too hard or were unable to to figure out how to properly manage the  curse  bar mechanic  in terms of progression  the game follows a style similar to slay the spire which you will notice in one of the screen shots provided by the devs  at the end of each room you will be able to choose either a  relic  which you can have i think up to 6 of  that will give you a boost to one of many things  be it damage reduction  some form of life gain  increase weapon damage  ect  or you can choose a path with a weapon altar that you can buy a weapon from  or a path that will allow you to upgrade a weapon of your choice ect  you get the idea now  as for this curse mechanic i talked about earlier that alot of the negative reviews are about  yes  it can be annoying  but not all of the curses are bad  id say its about roughly 33 33 33  and by that i mean  33  of all curses are bad scary  33  you will look at and go  this is nothing to be afraid of  i can live deal with this  it tis no threat   and the last 33  of all curses you will go  that is not a curse  its a buff  sweet   as for the  final curse   which is if you max out your normal curses  then it gives you a curse that drains your health every 3 seconds or so  i dont know if its a flat amount or percent based  but the one time i got it  it ticked away for 11 dmg every 2 3 seconds  maybe faster there are ways to get rid of curses and ways to reduce your curse bar  its legit not hard to manage  as long as your not brainlessly buying every single upgrade you can using blood offerings  one of the 2 options given to pay for buffs   and you are able to dodge parry enemy attacks more often then not  cause getting hit also increases the bar  some enemy attacks increase it more then others   you should be fine  you can also remove curses by choosing to fight an optional  champion  or  boss  on your route as you travel if you notice you got 3 or more curse s or you got an annoying curse that you wanna get rid of asap  general rule of the thumb though  if you are about to get your third curse  or know you will soon before getting to the second non optional boss  then make it a point to kill an optional boss champion before hand  also offering  cursed  weapons to the gods will sometimes remove a curse and there are relics weapon affixes which can remove curse meter through various meansas for the games controls  as a controller user and i must say  i 100  agree with the devs that this game is meant to be played with a controller  i do not recommend mouse keyboard at all  this is not the type of game for it   i found them to be fine  although i did rebind them to my own preference and all keys are rebindable too btw however i will say this  this game is very very anti  save scumming   game crash  guess what  your run is deleted and your back at the start  power died  too bad  so sad  alt f4 because you thought you could just re do the room since you did it poorly  no soup for you           get back to the start like the noob you are     you can only save at the very very start of each room  do not let the  saving game  text at the top of the screen fool you  if you need to close the game  do so at the start of a new room  all this means that if your looking for a game to beat on the hardest setting that you know wont be looked at with people thinking  he most likely just abused the games saving features to win  for an achievement that you can 100  be proud of  then this is the game for you for sure another warning though  this is one of those games  where once you  beat  it  you then unlock the hard mode  allowing you to get the  true ending   so if you thought the normal mode was tuff  oh boy  your in for a world of hurt  oh and dont count on 100  this game  for the memoirs achievement  you have to kill all bosses with out getting hit 10 times  and the last boss with out getting hit 5 times  on any difficulty setting   among some other annoying things thats pretty much it  do i recommend this game  if you consider yourself to be at least  average  in terms of skill for this genre  then yes  but if your reaction times are lacking  by that i mean  if you cant react quickly  or if your prone to tunnel vision during intense combat in tight spaces vs 3  or more enemies then that sometimes   then perhaps this game is not for you  either way  i personally enjoyed this game alot as for anything else that might be a con  the only thing i can think of is that it can take a little bit to load the first time you start of the game during a play session  about  id say  30ish seconds  guessing this varies from one computer to another overall  id say this is a great  decently challenging  game that does not hold your hand  the game ran smoothly for me with no issues  hopefully this review helps you to choose whether or not this game is for you p s one last thing id like to add after reading some more reviews as of late  the game does have story  its just not shown through out the gameplay like most other games  its in the beastiary memoirs sketch book thingy  the more you unlock of it  the more story you get  so if you want to read the story  you just gotta go to the sketch book beastiary memoir thingy in the game",2023-10-19,2023-12-31,True,44,0,0.773440361022949219,0,True,False,False

switched it off and didn t play it again  until recently  what attracted me to it back then was it being a well reviewed dark fantasy rpg made by obsidian  one of my favourite devs   and i was intrigued by the idea of a modern take on the older black isle studios and bioware dnd crpgs  as much as i was intrigued by the game  i just didn t really have the mental energy to play a very obviously densely detailed and wordy kind of game like this  back in 2015 the witcher 3  cities  skylines  mgsv  and fallout 4 all came out too but having really enjoyed playing through baldur s gate 3 recently  i couldn t help notice a lot of people compare this game in a favourable sense  many even declaring this game is better  i was itching for more crpg goodness anyway  so i decided i d finally give this game a proper play through  h3 visuals  audio   performance  h3 i did enjoy the way this game looks  the game has a very effective dark and brooding kind of look  whilst also managing to be quite fantastical and mysterious  for instance  you ll see very typical looking wooden medieval homes and castles  but then they are juxtaposed with strange large organic crystals and ancient esoteric mechanical structures  there s also more modern looking structures and things like early guns  like early renaissance era things  animancy  the  scientific  study of souls  is a strong theme in this game  various forms of undead are prevalent in the game  there s also more typical fantasy mobs like ogres  trolls  giant spiders and dragons  humans  dwarves and elves are in the game  but it also has its own unique races such as aumaua  orlan and godlike  there s also some interesting unique mobs like xaurips  reptilian humanoids  or vithrack  spider like humanoids with  cipher  abilities  as stated  i liked the way the game looks  it s familiar but very much has it s own thing going on  it does look very retro  with the fixed isometric pre rendered maps and the small 3d character and mob models  but  i can t fault the game for it s level of detail and art style  details like the mist and rain weather effects  the swaying vegetation and flickering lights  and the different spells and attack animations and particle effects are very nice i particularly liked the nice subtle background music as you wonder around  some of it kind of reminded me of the lord of the rings soundtrack at times  which i enjoyed  although  the combat music i didn t really like  it was too repetitive and thudding for my tastes to be honest  and got on my nerves a bit after a while  i would ve appreciated a separate volume slider for it the voice acting  when it happens  is really good  at times exceptional in fact  durance in particular is a stand out performance  it s just a shame there isn t more of it  i do appreciate va cost money  and there is a lot of dialogue in this game  but it can be very disorientating frequently switching from reading to listening performance was good enough  i did notice some frame rate dips occasionally during more intense fights with large amounts of mobs and spells going on  but never to a degree that bothered me  load times could be quite long sometimes  i didn t experience any significant bugs or crashes  h3 story  h3 it would be hard to talk about the story of pillars of eternity in too much specific detail without spoiling it  what i can say in general is that the game focuses on themes of animancy  memories and past lives  war  race  politics  and gods and their influence over different groups of mortals i really enjoyed the quality of the writing in this game  it did not dumb down anything  and was not afraid to go into great and extensive detail on dark and disturbing things  you could make the argument that it perhaps goes into too much detail at some points  and can be a bit mind boggling at points  and it did annoy me a little bit in that way  but i cannot fault the depth of the world building or quality of the writing what i particularly enjoyed was the themes of memories and the ramifications of experimenting with souls that it explores  although the way the game ends i was a little bit disappointed by  i thought it was interesting  and i respect the point the game was trying to convey  i was just a little disappointed by the options given to you to respond to a certain key bit of information given to you right at the end  it s like you just have to accept it  for a game that does freedom of choice making so well  i felt it slightly falters in that regard right at the end  h3 gameplay  h3 a classic style isometric crpg with combat that uses rtwp  there is a lot of fighting mobs in this game  talking to people and making choices  wondering around and looting  choosing load outs  trading  crafting  levelling up and choosing skills and spells  and enchanting your weapons and armours the game does the whole rpg thing of choosing a class and customising it to your liking really well  and it does exploration and choice making really well too  i feel like the combat in the game could have been better though  it s either like you don t really do much at all in combat and just let the ai beat the mobs for you  or you are just constantly pausing and micromanaging your party  the combat is at its best when it s somewhere in between these two things  but rarely was it like that for me  don t get me wrong  it s not like i m saying the combat wasn t enjoyable at all  i liked the different abilities you can use and how you can combine them and stuff  but it could have been better balanced in my opinion there s an interesting approach to stats and skills and a reputation system going on in this game  it s well done and works well generally speaking  there is no kind of dice rolling going on during conversations  it s more about your skills and reputation opening up conversation options  the choice and the consequences of the choice is what matters here you also end up with a stronghold to manage in the game  and there is a lot of side quests to do  some of them are quite simple  some of them are more complex  the game tries it s best to avoid the whole fetch quest trope  and has fleshed out side stories with detailed characters and interesting choices to be made  there is a lot to do in this game  perhaps a bit too much at some points though  h3 lasting appeal   value for money  h3 it took me about 100 hours to get to the end credits  with doing the white march part i   ii dlc and most of the side quests  that was just playing on normal though  and i didn t quite do every quest  there is certainly a lot to do in this game  and the choice and class based story and gameplay certainly gives it a lot of replay potential  whether i d actually want to play it again any time soon i m not sure  it s a lot  though certainly i am interested in playing the sequel at some point i bought the base game years ago i think for about  8 from a key reseller  i bought the dlc recently each for about  6  so about  20 the game cost me  you can buy them as a bundle on steam for about  35 which regularly goes on sale for about  9  i definitely do think the game is good value for money  h3 conclusion  h3 so  would i agree with those who say this is a better game than baldur s gate 3  no  it just isn t quite the complete package in the way that game is  but it is a really great game  i do think it falters with it s combat a bit and the game can go into too much detail at some points  but i ve got to commend it for its intent  what i really enjoyed about it was the quality of the writing  the really solid rpg mechanics  the world building  and the well implemented choice making  h3 score  h3   visuals   8 5 10  audio   8 5 10  performance   8 5 10  story   9

before i knew it i had ended up spending 120  hours in game  review is after completing the main game and all dlc and both expansions  including all main quests  companion quests  side quests and tasks on normal difficulty   h3 pros   h3  list    i enjoyed all the reading  especially the named npc backstories  all the expertly written exposition surprisingly helped with one of my english exams    the game allowed me to delay levelling up  which is a highly appreciated feature  i was able to level up based on the challenge the game offered at each progressive stage    the game had a relaxed inventory system that promoted hoovering up all loot  after all  in a world with magic why would they even need to worry about carry weight    i particularly liked the wizards summoning of  b thick  b   i slimy  i  tentacles with which to pound enemies    the game soundtrack was entertaining and the option to download it and enjoy it at leisure was most welcome    side quests supplied choices that had both large and small consequences in later acts and in the ending    this game is called the spiritual successor to baldur s gate  in my opinion this is appropriate    companion quests had strong writing  excellent voice acting and were quite varied  i liked how some of them provided closure while others didn t necessarily do so  as is often the case in reality    there are no romance options in the game  perfect  it would have made zero sense for my wild orlan to romance my odd brigade of companions  obsidian didn t shoehorn romance into this game and that is ideal    figuring out the use of ai combat patterns and group formations felt smooth and organic    at the beginning of the dlc and act3  the game inquired if i wanted to increase the challenge as i was overleveled  i declined  as the overleveled state was intentional  but the feature to ask the player s choice was most welcome    the game provides named unique items  which can be upgraded or enchanted depending on the item type  the dlc also adds more unique weapons that can be bound to certain characters by fulfilling various conditions  i felt this was a very thematic and appropriate system considering the lore of the game    i was quite saturated at the point of playing the white march part 2  over 100 hours in this game i never intended to invest in  so i lowered the difficulty a notch to help speed through fights faster  as such  the ability to adjust difficulty at any time was much appreciated    notable voice acting by the actors for eder  aloth and durance  all other companions also have superb voice acting  moreover  i felt the main villain s voice actor played their part incredibly well  the majority of side characters also had decent voice acting    speaking of world building  now that i have devoted over 100  hours into this game i am fully invested in the world of eora  all that s left to say is   more please     the game dropped hints of the deadfire archipelago  setting up some lore for the next game   list  h3 cons   h3  list    while it appeared enticing to obtain all the achievements of this game  some of them required a level of dedication i simply couldn t spare    at the 90  mark of act 2  i felt overloaded  after exploring the entire world map thus far  the game dumped a new capital city with its own culture and lore on me  i was weighed down by this  especially because i felt their culture was uncivilised and barbaric and it tested my patience  perhaps because  at this point i just wanted to be done with act 2    loading times were bad right from the beginning of the game and progressively got worse  quicksaving felt like the easier option  manual saving or loading felt like a painful option    when playing the white march part 2 i experienced occasional freezing of the game  waiting for about 1 to 2 minutes resolved these issues    when loading the save file list doing a mouse click would freeze the game  windows asked whether to close poe but being patient resolved the issue   list  h3 advice   h3  list    i played while occasionally referring to a walkthrough from gamefaqs  i learned that lesson from playing divinity original sin  my advice is explore and play a new map area dungeon as you please while manual saving often  then refer to the walkthrough to check if you missed any hidden area item quest approach dialogue  as this is a large game  investing in a second playthrough can be extremely time consuming  therefore  it s best to experience the complete buffet of game content in the very first playthrough    another benefit of referring to a walkthrough was discovering the optimal playthrough order  that would be  poe act 1  poe act 2  white march p1  poe act 3  white march p2  poe epilogue  that approach covered all of the definitive edition content in a chronological manner    the dragon battles were the toughest in my opinion  the other encounters could be managed using kiting  drawing enemies to narrow corridors or springing traps or ambushes     the game dumps a large amount of lore and history from character creation itself  much of it didn t make sense until act 2 and onwards  therefore  a healthy amount of patience is required  perhaps this was intentional as the developers had to create all this new lore and world history from scratch  certainly no easy task    wizards are the most fun class and next would be priests  their wide range of spells  buffs and debuffs offered the greatest opportunity for creative problem solving gameplay    refer to an online build guide  i played as a wild orlan  furry   paladin  sword and shield tank built to specifications  therefore  i had a much smoother combat experience having an incredibly durable tank character   list so what exactly are these so

member of a caravan travelling to the town of gilded vale  for the reasons of your choice  but this quickly changes as the unfolding events connect you to the world of spirits  troubled with visions of a dark future and mysterious past  you set off to find the answers to a terrifying curse  only to find more questions  b the good  b  list     i m a sucker for a good story and  i pillars of eternity  i  delivers exactly that  with the plot revolving around sinister happenings in the region of dyrwood that cause tragic consequences for all of its denizens  while intrigues between the gods and mortals may be a common trope in rpg genre  here it s expanded on by the lore that s exceptionally rich and original  the story may not be the easiest to get a full grasp on  but the superb focus on lore and plot presentation makes it absolutely special  there s also tons of extra information about the world  its history and mystical forces that drive it  for those interested in fuller immersion     at first i was sceptical of a story dlc split into two parts  but then it turned out it was completely unfounded  don t be fooled by the shared title   i the white march  i     both dlcs bring plenty of different gameplay extras  part 1 adds a new region to explore  a storyline of an abandoned forge able to shape the world and a couple of mechanical improvements  part 2 expands on that  as well as grants access to a couple of high level challenges  overall  a very strong  and long  addition  definitely worth its price  the only caveat i have is that the storyline isn t well matched with the main game and can provide too much distraction from  you know  actually saving the world  maybe it s not that important after all     there s so much stuff to do in the game you ll have spent dozens of hours before you re finished  an incredible asset of pillars of eternity is that no quest seems unsubstantial  not even the most trivial task feels forcefully shoved into the game to artificially bloat it  and your hero always feels to exist in the middle of affairs of great importance  and some of these really are important  as your choices craft your further experience with people you meet  organisations of dubious intents and events that progress your way to an inevitable clash with the ultimate evil     and speaking of choices  the game emphasises their significance through the system of reputation and personality traits  a multivariate approach to shaping the world s responses to your actions  each region and major organisation has its own view on your hero through separate reputation stats  allowing you to be the saviour and the villain at the same time  depending on your roleplaying needs  and consequences of treading your path reach beyond just that with the personality trait scores that increase purely based on your decisions  gaining some traits open new options for resolving quests or dialoguing and may as well make some things harder if your interlocutor doesn t fancy you being too honest or cruel     the classes are the shining beacon of mechanical diversity of the game  even the rpg usuals such as the warrior or the wizard aren t just a copy paste of what you see in an average representative of the genre  gaining multiplicity of advancement perks and options that may lean their progress towards a satisfactorily different playstyle if that s what you want  and then you have the bard with their chants you get to craft depending on what passive boons you need at the moment  only to strike with powerful magic once you ve sung enough  the cipher that uses psychic abilities to easily break through the enemy s defences  or the monk whose powers rely on getting their cheeks clapped during a fight  if you re in for somewhat expansive mechanics that at the same time aren t overwhelming  your playthrough may get a couple of more hours spent on checking out the available options     the stronghold is such a cool base of operations it actually needs its own point on this list  not only you get to bring back its greatness with various upgrades  but you also get a couple of different  filler  types of content  like deciding the fates of people in the area  extra side quests for your inactive companions or getting ingredients for your alchemical shenanigans  it s a very interesting way of expanding the game s lore and strengthening the immersion     a lot of thought was put into the sonic presentation of the game  the music hauntingly fills the atmosphere of events and places together with thoroughly mastered sound effects  and voice actors clearly committed to their jobs as well     it s a game tailored for a wide range of rpg fans out there  whether you re a casual player  a tactical mastermind or anyone in between  there s enough gameplay settings for you to craft your ideal experience  need an extra safeguard when your companion is about to die  no problem  want to disable tooltips to seep more realism into your game  sure thing  feel like getting ultimately challenged  try the path of the damned mode  and regret later    or go the other way around and explore the world  almost  freely with the story time difficulty   list  b the so so  b  list     there s a good deal of dialogue option to choose from and some of them bear great importance and equally great consequences  but too many are hidden behind ridiculous stat requirements that feel almost unreachable at the current level of progress  sometimes you can t get back to the core of a discussion after picking an option that may have sounded completely neutral  like an innocent question before digging deeper into the topic  in a way it s a method of preventing your hero from becoming an all knowing mary sue   which is a good thing   but then you may be left with a feeling that they re actually quite dumb for not having come up with an idea that seemed pretty obvious  but it s locked behind a stat requirement  also screw you  resolve  for almost being a must pick in this department     there s many equipment options to fit into your desired playstyle and those more gifted in figuring out mechanical details may feel at home with the ability to switch weapon sets depending on the enemy s armour type and whatnot  but to me it all lacks the oomph  there s a couple of powerful items you need to upgrade by meeting certain conditions  which is an interesting concept   but everything else feels rather samey  it s not entirely bad  because you don t need to push for the greatest rewards in order to enjoy the game  but at the same time you don t even have to look at your inventory screen after a certain point   list  b the bad  b  list     pathfinding is just dire  the characters seem to take up more space than what s shown on the screen  or maybe they re just all stupid  who knows  what i definitely know  though  is that multiple encounters ended up much worse than they could have purely because my companions struggled to move their pixel bodies to designated points  even though they really shouldn t  if there s two tips i can give you  one is  avoid fighting in corridors  even if they seem wide enough       and the other one is  practice your patience   because that s what s going to be strained during loading screens  the game just loads forever  maybe that s the  eternity  part of the title  since i actually never figured that one out   list  b overall  b  i pillars of eternity  i  takes what s best in rpg genre and incorporates it into a unique universe  it s packed with a really great plot  interesting events and memorable characters  as well as fun mechanics that are void of major holes  for me it was definitely more of a story driven game than one that shines bright with its gameplay  but

and i think its a bit of a marvel for what it is   but it is not particularly enjoyable so many people keep repeating its like a wes anderson film   it is not   i think someone on youtube said it and its just getting parroted    i mean it really has nothing in common with w a films which are primarily styled to embody theater dramas   so if you are  fan of his  dont expect this to be in his style   it is not   it really is its own thing   but a basic disney pixar film comes closest   it is though  basically a movie with  buttons needed to progress it   it was excruciatingly slow at times   i found myself spamming buttons as conversations drolled on and on   every now and then  in the middle of a very long conversation  an option to choose a response popped up but i usually missed them from spamming the buttons    they just talked so damn slow    and walking is incredibly slow    this is the kind of game where your hand starts to hurt because you keep pushing the joystick harder and harder hoping for the character to speed up  i like walking sims  i have played a lot of walking sims   and typically they center on a mystery and finding clues   this does not follow that design  this is instead just basically following a kind of boring character discover themselves and some philosophy stuff thrown in   by boring i mean that harold is sort of boring as a personality   not as  he isnt interesting    he is interesting but from the standpoint that he is a boring person   he has nothing really going for him   he seems rather complacent and just goes along with whatever because there is no reason not to   and he realizes he doesn t want to be that person   but also  who could he be   not a lot of options   he isn t really a big hero or anything of the story   at the end  spoiler warning at the end he just decides he d rather do something different than stay with the humans who are heading back to earth   but even this role is kind of bland   its not like there is a role for him there   but also its not like he really had a strong relationship with any of the humans   and in the game they keep emphasizing that harold had a strong relationship with the mailman  but i only had the chance to meet him once so it was weird that this relationship was emphasized so much as harolds main squeeze     harold has no back story   no forward story   nothing about family   when he later says he is in his 20s i thought maybe they were going to talk about him transitioning from lonely child to lonely adult with routine leading his life   i thought that could be interesting     but they never touched on that   the conspiracy part of the company was kind of flat   i thought they were going to learn that it hadn t been 200 years since they left earth but that the people on the ship now were the earth people  but they forgot somehow   and they were all there to do something nefarious   or some other big plot twist   nope   nothing really interesting there    and the bad guy s rational for freezing the ocean is just silly   and makes no sense  also  so they say the journey to earth will be 200 years   but like  no one on the ship seems to care that they wont be alive by the time they get back   no one else decides to stay   even the mentor lady says something about looking forward to standing on the ground  but she wont be alive to do that  that said   the game is really rather unique   and i do enjoy something new and original   although the story was rather bland there was some parts that were interesting   some of the philosophy stuff was interesting but also a lot of it felt like they were talking in circles and not saying anything  to be fair a lot of philosphy does that      the soundtrack was pretty good   performance  meh  i had a few crashes near the start   and i updated my gpu and that seemed to mostly fix it   i fell through the floor once   a few times  even near the end  the conversation ran on auto super fast   like faster than i wanted and it just auto went through it so fast i barely could tell what they said and this was not due to me pushing buttons     the sprint button seemed to not work very well in the last 2 hours of game play  there is this part in the game where you say good bye to all the fish people and its all cinamatic  and in slow mo   its already slow and they slowed it down more    it was insane   i actually just held the joystick and made myself some dinner  in the kitchen and when i came back it still hadn t finished the walk   no joke   it takes like 3 minutes to walk a short distance there was a side mission to deliver mail to people but i wasn t able to do it   i got to the major s letter but it would not let me deliver it to him  it wouldn t let me interact with him to give him the letter  while he was at the school area    also the few options you get in conversations seem like they dont make any difference there are a few times in the story where it seems like you are going to be presented with two options to resolve an issue  like with rafi   giving her a music tape or black mailing her into compliance with a request   but when you go to her  you just give her the tape automatically  these things might be bugs  i dk   play the game for the aesthetics and for a unique game play experience   dont play for the story  the characters  or puzzles   it was like 6 8 hrs in until i got to interact with the alien  i mean  common    you just fart around until then   and then do some more farting around afterwards  id say buy it to support the dev team who did something bold and new   e for effort  and i think effort counts for a lot   but i did not really enjoy the game   i hope to see more games with this style in the future   games that are more enjoyable though   its a good start though   a lot of potential    also this game is huge   its like 50gb  wth",2024-04-18,2024-04-18,True,18,0,0.663538634777069092,4,True,False,False

simulations of any transport business tycoon game  an order of magnitude  maybe two  better than transport fever 2  the simple factor of  cargo moves on its own  just slower  was not only realistic  rrt3 maps had built in competition and incentive  tpf2  and many  many other games of this type  are more  sandbox  than  tycoon    there s a business aspect  but there s no stock market and no real mechanism to counter a player s network once it s even moderately developed  keep hauling passengers and keep printing money  the government will never start a highway building program  no competitors will ever challenge you  keep the bottom line reasonable and you ll quickly get to a 250m  company so it s kind of a sandbox  fine  it s a gorgeous sandbox for this type of game  pixel art and isometric is its own thing  but the world here looks fantastic  i like trains  everything else is just a means to get more passengers and cargo on the trains so i can run big trains and make stupid money while i watch the trains go by  the vanilla trains are all totally acceptable and most look nice at full zoom  steam locomotives have animated valve gear and the stock sounds are alright  the workshop has tons of content for free  if your machine can handle it  that s often more detailed and interesting  like cities  skylines  if you haven t tried some of the workshop stuff  you re missing out on half the game it s really clear that this was based on something that was mostly centered around trains  train fever  plays    ok but still looks fine   the track construction system is one of the better i ve used in a 3d environment  and is intuitive but powerful  vehicle management and timing is critical to success  and the vehicles handle realistically enough to believe  this forces the player to think about train lengths  track geometry  signal placement  etc  signals are not as overwhelming as some simutrans variants  although i love me some signalling  but have enough complexity to add interest  after maybe an hour and a half of working with it  you can understand the ui and where everything is  and be building railroad lines that s not to say other vehicles are half baked  the ships  planes and road vehicles are also well modeled and great to look at and you could just as easily play this game as an airline builder sandbox as you could a railroad builder sandbox the biggest disappointment  and one that can be  somewhat   fixed  with various workshop mods  is the lack of complexity in the economy  you ship the same six finished products to cities and none of them require special handling beyond the vehicle type  there is no postal system  there is no stock market  there is no local government  industries pop up randomly  there are no  mining regions  or  growing regions  or  manufacturing regions  like in real life  or rrt3   city buildings are the only attractions for passengers  no monuments special attraction buildings  and the area of the stations is large  making developing feeder networks quick but simplistic  you never face any real competition  as mentioned  your maximum loan is a fixed amount  you can run a company with a couple billion in assets and tens of millions in annual income  and you have the same maximum loan as a company totally in the red for its entire existence the campaign feels decidedly like an afterthought and is pretty uninspired compared to rrt3  haul enough of this here and you win  and some of the goods are re skinned  most of the campaign has very little in the way of financial constraints and you can do whatever you want with very little challenge  you have no real incentive to build thoughtfully because the missions are meaningless and arbitrary  and you ll be on to the next scenario  which is fundamentally the same as the one you re playing  in a few hours anyway  i made it to era 3 before i got bored  the free game is way more interesting since the campaign is really just a re skin of the free game  the campaign soundtrack  though  is a jam  and the campaign would be much more worth playing if you could unlock the tracks for the free game by completing a mission  yes i know you can copy and paste the files   the soundtrack overall is way better than most  up there with rrt3  and that matters when you re going to spend a few hundred hours listening to it while you re building tracks  it s not  old west railroad music  with harmonicas and banjos like rrt3  but it s funky and chill at the same time  so it sticks in your head the same way  not really a point to recommend the game  since the game is good enough on its own  but it s very nice icing on the cake so is this a new rrt3  no  it s considerably simpler in some important ways  both the economy environment as a whole  and in the engagement and cohesiveness of the campaign  these are the big things that give rrt3 its lasting charm  for me at least  the campaign here is less engaging and memorable than the soundtrack  where i can still remember some of the rrt3 campaign events from playing it 20 years ago is it better than rrt3  in a certain sense  yeah  it looks better and it handles more realistically  and the added diversity of vehicles adds some depth to the gameplay to make up  considered on the campaign alone  which isn t really the point as much with tpf2 and was most of the point in rrt3   it s considerably worse  considered on the basis of pre rendered intro videos with y2k era cgi  rrt3 has that tied up buy it  not a bad choice  but that s my opinion full price  if you like this type of game  you ll get your money s worth  the dev is active and makes meaningful updates to the core game  sale  if you ve ever played a business or management or tycoon type game and liked it  yeah  tpf2 is easy to get into  unlike i e  simutrans  although i ve got a couple few thousand hours into that at this point  and looks great  while running pretty well on a lower mid spec system at 720p  even

games  buy it on a sale   i  hr   hr  h1 in depth review  h1  h3 visuals  h3 despite coming from two different genres  the designs of toodee and topdee look similar in style  the only difference is from the perspective  where toodee looks flatter  mainly because it s in a side scroller view  while topdee has more depth due to its top down view  since both of their worlds merged  the perspective of the level changes depending on who is in charge  toodee s world is on the sidescroller view while topdee s is in the isometric view  i like how smooth the transition between both perspectives is  that being said  the visuals themselves are decent  although i found the character sprites to be bland  h3 story  h3 i like how the game gives some background on how our two hero s worlds merged  there are also some references to basic programming in the dialogue  both in the story and in one character  i like how the latter one was designed  and how it actually makes sense for them to do what they do  the story itself is quite straightforward  but i like how each character and boss have their own personality  h3 the game  h3  b gameplay  b since two worlds merged into one  you need both toodee and topdee to solve the levels  topdee s world is top down  so it seems that they can walk in the sky based on toodee s perspective  on the other hand  topdee has what toodee doesn t have  jumping both characters need to cooperate to reach the goal  topdee can help by pushing blocks for toodee to walk on  while toodee can help to drop some blocks since their world has gravity  pass through holes that can t be passed by topdee  and destroy brittle platforms to open the path the game has 5 main chapters  with 2 extras in it  the first 4 chapters have 20 levels with a boss fight at the end of each chapter  each chapter will showcase a different main obstacle for you to try  however  i don t like the obstacles introduced in the latter half of the game  the levels in the first two chapters can be completed in several seconds  but some levels in the latter chapters might force you to spend minutes  moreover  some of those levels  especially the one in the bonus chapter  rely too much on timing  i don t like precision platformers with hardly any room for error  and the last few chapters of the game are just that https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2713413793despite you having to be precise to finish the levels  the controls aren t helping with that  topdee walks too fast  and it s hard to precisely control them  the thing is  they can push blocks just by slightly touching them  and it s easy to push them by accident  as for toodee  while they are good for the most part  they can t seem to jump right away after landing  and there are times when they automatically jump when they are on the edge of a platform  i had issues on some levels because of it and had to resort to using the accessibility options for some since i couldn t seem to get it right  b boss fights  b the boss fights are unique  i like how they are designed  especially since they require the cooperation of both characters to beat  the character switching is mainly done whenever the boss is changing on a certain phase  which is triggered by your character s action  it can take some time to remember the pattern and get the muscle memory to beat the boss  but i had fun beating them however  i found the boss rush at one of the bonus levels to look cheap  since the game mainly only has 1 health  you need to beat them without taking damage  but it can be hard to do so  especially since you have to fight 4 bosses in a row  it seems as if the developer is running out of ideas for a boss and put this feature in  i would appreciate it more if there is a brand new boss that i can fight  even if they have more health and are more difficult to beat https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2705037593 b length and difficulty  b i finished the game in 9 5h with most of its contents unlocked  the game offers some sort of challenge by finishing the level below a certain time limit and switching characters as little as possible  which i did mostly through the accessibility option to save time  it isn t difficult to finish the game as long as you use them the game offers an accessibility option for casual players  you technically can cheese most of the levels with it  except some that require you to use your wits  despite that  you still can use the accessibility option to save some time on those levels  you can finish the whole game and get all achievements but one with these options https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2705037530achievement hunters need to suffer to 100  it  though  there is one achievement that requires you to finish the whole game without dying or retrying  you need to go from the very first level in the chapter to the last one  which is usually the boss fight  without returning to the main menu  you can t tweak the accessibility option for this and i just find it ridiculous to finish  especially since i had to retry a lot of times just to finish one level at the latter part of the game  i did try to finish most levels without accessibility options at least once  so i know that it s impossible for me to get this without spending tons of hours into the game  which i d rather not do  the worst part is that there is content hidden behind this achievement  i know the content is trivial  but it still sucks  h1 conclusion  h1 the accessibility options in  b topdee and toodee  b  help to make me enjoy the game  it s a difficult game by nature  one which i don t like  and i had to complain a lot just to finish some of the later levels  moreover  the controls make it hard for me to precisely move my character as i want  i still enjoyed it to some extent  but i don t think casual players should play it  some levels require you to act fast  which can be an issue if you are not that good  even with accessibility options  the game is best for hardcore players who are looking for some challenge in both wits and reflexes",2023-12-24,2023-12-24,True,12,0,0.659495830535888672,0,False,True,False

glitches  which aleph created an assistant named toodoo so these glitches can be kept track of so they can all be fixed later and to help out  but as aleph came to only needing to create one more world  toodoo became worried  as when aleph finishes up the last world and finally has time to deal with those pesky glitches  toodoo won t have any purpose anymore  so toodoo  determined not to be thrown away  steals the semicolon  causing all of the worlds to collide into one and this is when two characters from two different worlds meet  toodee  from the 2d universe  and topdee  from the top down universe  against all chances gets put in the same area and after getting the news of what happened from a newly born glitch  they decide to join forces and find the missing semicolon the story here is pretty cute  well aside from the whole worlds colliding and terrible things are happening part  the dialog really hits that perfect spot for me where it s cute  funny  and simple  but not so much where it harms the game either by being annoying or not properly conveying what it wants to  i looked forward to every cutscene as it never failed to make me smile as toodee and topdee talk to each other or to other characters to find the semicolon you ll have to take advantage of both perspectives available to you by switching between both topdee and toodee  both of them will interact with the world differently  toodee is the platformer as he can jump across platforms and gaps  while topdee can move boxes  but will need to use these boxes to create a bridge for gaps  not to mention some aspects like boxes or the characters themselves will freeze once you switch to the other  the puzzles start simple  like having topdee move boxes so toodee can use them as platforms and grabbing keys to unlock walls  it does start to get more complex as more elements are introduced  soon you ll have puzzles that will require good timing to have a block drop and pause at the right moment  having you think about the order you do things in  or avoid deadly animals that go on a basic path for toodee  but will full on pursue topdee  and looking scary at that   and it will only get more difficult  and complex to get both topdee and toodee to that level ending portal as you get more levels under your belt that s not to say that it suddenly dumps challenging levels on you  there are multiple worlds you ll be going to which will introduce something new  it gives you enough levels to introduce you to the what s new and giving you multiple scenarios so when those hard levels do come in  you ll know what you probably need to do  but will need to figure out how to use topdee and toodee to get to your end goal toodee and topdee really knows when it s starting to overstay its welcome and i like how there weren t that many levels in each world  despite the interesting feature of switching between perspectives  i did feel times where i just wanted it to end and luckily those times came when i was nearing a boss fight at the end of each world  you ll get into a boss battle where you ll be fighting corrupted guardians  these are pretty fun as you ll need to learn their attack patterns  either by quick thinking or through many deaths  as you need to dodge attacks and find the perfect opportunity that will let the boss get damaged  not to mention that these bosses will change up their patterns when they get hurt  their attacks will affect topdee and toodee differently  so you ll need to switch between who can handle it the best  and some attacks can change depending on which perspective you re on  which can give you an opening to damaging them or a way to not die if the other can t dodge the attack themselves without getting hit if you are having problems  whether it s because you have no idea what the solution is or just tired of dying in one hit  there are some difficulty options you can turn on like giving you more health  air jumps  and lets you carry heavy boxes  i do wish there was some undo button  especially for topdee as it is easy to push a box in a hole without meaning to or switch at the wrong time for falling boxes  as it does get annoying when you get everything right and unscathed  but have to redo everything due to a simple mistake of going forward one too many  for that  i do recommend not playing this on controller  as it s easier to make these simple mistakes  or try to remember to only use the d pad as it s a bit imprecise when you use the stick though  for those looking for more of a challenge  if some of the harder levels aren t enough for you that is  there is another aspect that you might not notice until the end  there are actually three different challenges where the indicator is pretty lowkey  acting like it s just part of the level decoration  until your attention is brought to it  and that are the ladybugs  there are three different ladybug colors that represent a specific challenge and they can be hard to get  all levels will have at least two of the ladybugs where it challenges you to complete the level with the least number of switches  represented by a blue ladybug  and complete the level as fast as you can before the red ladybug flies away  with some levels having purple ladybugs  challenging you to not kill any of the deadly animals  if you do get all ladybugs you will unlock a secret portal to secret levels for you to do and get an additional  secret  ending considering this game does have two characters working together  there is a co op mode if you have someone to play with  i didn t dive much into it  but it basically acts like if you swap controllers as you ll take control of either topdee or toodee and you can decide if swapping can be done by both of you or just by the one that is active  and it might be even more helpful having another head to bounce puzzle solutions off of  though probably not so much for the puzzles that require good timing  h1 verdict  h1 toodee and topdee promised a unique spin on platformers and it delivered  while it did straddle the line of staying too long and getting frustrating at times for me  switching between 2d and top down perspectives to find a way to get past hazards and get both of them to the portal to solve the level was interesting and challenging  the boss battles were fun  and the dialog was delightful and funny  not to mention the optional ladybug challenges that will make this even more worth it if you decide to go for them  if you like puzzle platformers and looking for an interesting twist on the genre  you can t go wrong with toodee and topdee  code   check out my other reviews at  url http   saveorquit com author ripwitch  saveorquit  url  or visit my curator url https   store steampowered com curator 28714255

usually never review games outside of this genre  this is one of the very few exceptions  this game is a masterpiece that deserves way more attention grime is a dark and rather difficult metroidvania  obviously inspired by hollow knight and dark souls  but they are just inspirations  you never have the feeling that you re playing an unoriginal game you are a newly born black hole and you start your journey through this strange world you wake up in  there s not much you know  and the few npcs you ll encounter won t really help to better understand the world but one thing is clear   you re good at absorbing things and you get stronger  this primal instinct serves as your purpose as you explore the vast world of grime  it might seem too cryptic for nothing or too light as a plot  and i kinda had this feeling too during the major part of my playtime  but everything will eventually make sense  and i can safely say the lore is incredibly good and deep  everything in the game fits together  you won t be left with only theories at the end  like most games like this   you ll truly understand the world  your purpose and how original and beautiful this game is the visuals and the atmosphere are outstanding  exploring this surreal world is a pleasure  this game has tons of optional stuff and secrets  even secrets in secrets  and the rewards you get are worth it  especially at the beginning midgame  like any metroidvanias  there s also a lot of  optional  backtracking  it can be extremely tedious if you don t find the teleport ability in the early midgame  so i ll put its global location in a spoiler in case you re interested  spoiler  you get it from a boss in childbed   spoiler   i guess if you already thoroughly explore  you ll naturally find it anyway but the faster you get it  the better the game will be  otherwise you re left with the nervepasses  shortcuts to various areas  you ve discovered and  while they can be useful at times  they are not very efficient combat in this game is kinda slow  unlike most metroidvanias  you have a force gauge that drains each time you make an action  and you need to wait a bit to replenish it  some people will hate it  but it actually isn t a bad idea at all  as dashing drains a lot of force  you can t just spam it or you won t be able to attack  and if you keep attacking  you won t be able to properly dodge  this forces you to use the most important mechanic in combat   the parry  parrying an attack doesn t drain the force gauge  inflicts damage if there s no armor and lets you safely hit the enemy a few times if there s one the game also asks you to hunt and absorb every possible enemies  that is to say finishing them with a parry to absorb them  absorbing an enemy refills your breath gauge a bit  you can heal when it s full   adds ardor  the more you have  the more mass you get from enemies but i ll talk about that later  and also unlocks traits when your hunt quotas are fulfilled  the parry is important  and the game does a good job at permanently training you  it s not the ultimate move though  enemies also have attacks that can t be parried  you need to adapt  and that s why i think the combat is very interesting and perfectly balanced  slow  but still very skilled you ll die a lot though  the game is balanced but hard  any error costs a lot  especially against bosses where missing a parry or realizing you have no force to dash can mean death  fortunately  the game isn t punitive  the only thing you lose when you die is your number of ardor and it s not even completely lost  a statue spawns where you died and you get half your ardor back if you destroy it  you just respawn at the last savepoint  bosses are always near a savepoint so no problem  but exploration usually has its lot of tension  when you re low on health without any heal   will you play super safe or will you try a risky parry to refill your heal gauge there are also lots of platforming sections  and very good ones  especially after you ve gathered all the different powers from the bosses  these powers are classic but work so well  just pure fun the bosses require you to study their patterns  death is unavoidable for the first few tries  you ll have to use all your possible moves to defeat them  the focus is mainly on dodging parrying and speedkilling is not an option  they are all well crafted and not frustrating at all  the final performance  the penultimate bossfight  has to be one of the best i ve experienced for a long time  creating epic bosses is something easy to do  but creating elegant and emotionally charged ones is something you don t see that often that s just art  the sublime music and the context of this fight really helps a lot i talked about the ardor that increases the mass you gain  mass is gained when you destroy things  items or enemies and can then be used to upgrade your character   leveling up  upgrading your weapons or buying items something important to note is that your choices have to be made carefully  when you level up  you invest mass into one of your 5 skills   health  force  strength  dexterity and resonance  the first two are self explanatory but the last three are used for your weapons   any weapon requires a certain level in some skills to be used effectively  and they also scale with that skill  that means you cannot use all of the weapons you find  you have to commit to one playstyle if you want to get the maximum out of your chosen weapons  there are pearls you can use to reset your levels if you want to try or change weapons  but they are rare and you need 5 of them for a complete reset so    choose wisely the traits you gain from the hunt quotas i mentioned earlier are not active when you get them  you need to spend special points you get after destroying specific tougher enemies  and like the skills  you also need to choose wisely if you don t want to waste pearls  grime is a demanding game but it s so fun  nearly every aspect of the game is extremely well done  i thought that getting near the perfection of hollow knight was impossible  but i was wrong  i can t recommend it

now take the money management  traffic and energy management out  make buildings free and instantly ploppable and removable and add a terraforming layer to its mechanics  and essentially you have plan b now  you might be righfully asking what the hell is the point of a tycoon game where all but the basest elements of the experience are taken out  and that s a very good question  it s a strangely unrestricted  sandbox like experience where you ll just be free to place  remove and relocate buildings as you see fit  the goal being to raise the three cities on the entire planet to certain population milestones in order to unlock access to new buildings and resources  at first it will be very straightforward  but then your city s demands will start to increase  and that s when things start to get janky see  plan b has a very solid groundwork  sandboxiness aside  however  it also is incredibly vague when it comes to gauging efficiency  at first you will be compelled to trim your resource extractors to your production  but quickly this will prove unfeasible  while you might painstakingly plan your production complexes to use the exact amount of resources you need  what s the point when an extra producer doesn t cost anything extra  moreover  good luck when you exhaust a resource vein and need to move it over somewhere else  you will need to remove  by hand  one by one  each building and road segment  locate a different spot  and then put them down  one by one  segment by segment  in order to allow your cities to continue growing  sure  you can just pause the game and do everything without missing a beat  but it s painstaking and time consuming for the player all the same the game has no support for total production numbers  no overlay to see what buildings service another  no resource lines where you can gauge yield or transportation  no real numbers regarding city supply and waste management outside of a vaporous percentage  and soon you will start relying on feeling things out when it comes to locating bottlenecks and shortfalls in your production chains  you ll look at whether there s too much or too little resources on the stockpiles  or if factories are constantly operating to gauge what you should increase or decrease to keep things chugging along  you will constantly need to tweak  expand and transform production blobs in order to keep up with your cities  to the point where  if you re anything like me  you will eventually just surrender to the ever powerful temptation of spam  brute forcing your way through the game via spaghetti monstrosities that will forever increase alongside your cities in an unsatisfying  ever growing maw that only wants more regardless of how much shit you throw at it  trucks and trains will phase through each other too  so in all likelihood you will also end up just spamming those  cramming your roads and rails with transports without a care  moreover when vehicles can only be assigned to transport one resource  from point a to point b and that s it  while they are essentially free to build  the most efficient and quick way to build things devolves in just tacking shit over your already existing infrastructure until absolutely necessary to change  ultimately leading to a frustrating and unsatisfying experience  why make it tidy when you re going to have to expand or relocate in a few hours  why make it efficient when you can just plop 2 extra factories or trains down at virtually no cost this game is in early access  and i respect what the developer is trying to do  however  my opinion is that the caotic  free form and impossible to optimize by design experience that is shooting for needs a bit of rethinking  i m not saying the game needs to be an anal urban planner simulator  but being able to see how much exactly a city needs and how much a given area is producing  what buildings are connected where  a simplified view of the transport network  approximate yields for a given resource patch and production overviews  alerts when something runs out of resources and blueprint functionality would immensely help in trying to wrangle the ever expanding chaos that plan b devolves into instead of turning the game into a frustrating spam a thon where you always feel in the knife s edge trying to grow your cities for a handful of seconds until they need supervision again do i recommend the game  if you re a city builder or transport tycoon game fan  you will surely get a kick out of the sandboxy  almost liberating approach this game takes to management and building  but in all likelihood you will give up before taking full advantage of what the game has to offer  it is a curious approach to the genre however  that if anything is very

sense  just go to recent reviews and you ll immediately see my point  you ll notice most talk about things that can be solved with simple common sense  but instead choose to make mute points to make a marvelous game look like the hottest piece of trash on the market  so let me spin my review on why this game is amazing for first month release   for the shortest answer if you re too busy with your day  its a 8 10 maybe 7 atm  for the more dedicated or simply curious individuals  here s the more in depth review   b  overview   b    have a nice death is a 2d platforming rougelite in which you take control over death himself in managing his own company in the afterlife  known as death inc  the game play loop revolves around you navigating these 2d environments via exploration  combat  and the occasional mini boss thanagers and area bosses sorrows  to aid you in all of this your good friend t  o shah  not even death himself can escape mandatory osha inspections   who provides you with curses which are buffs that assist you throughout your journey to beat your employees back into submission  there are several different departments you ll navigate as you venture out through the company  ranging from the damp and odorous pollution department  to greasy and savory toxic food processing department  hand is sure to deliver some creative and diverse set pieces for your eyes to enjoy    b  gameplay   b    while most who have  played the game  in the negative section would call it slow and clunky  this cannot be further from the truth  the game allows for diverse methods of movement  be it with your invincible dash or even through more creative means with your up slash with your scythe allowing almost instantaneous upward momentum  the game revolves around you not taking damage and actively aids in helping you do this easier through the curses  though a good portion don t seem to understand this and chalk it up to either bad design or  difficulty   besides your scythe which comes equipped with several different variations you may have the chance of encountering at the very beginning of each run  death inc  supplies you with other tools such as cloak weapons and spells  the key difference between the 2 being that cloak weapons are bound by a cool down  while spells are dependent on mana conservation  they are also buffed more by the red  attack  portion of the tree while spells have their own green  spell  tree  with blue being largely for healing and defense  while minor atm due to the games fresh release  there are some creative ways the moveset interacts with your environment  such as using your form of healing  anima  to unlock secret rooms which house special goodies ranging from more healing  to temporary buffs  to even legendary spells and weapons  all of your arsenal would be arbitrary if you didn t have some good enemy archetypes to knock some sense back into  luckily you don t get skimped out there either  the game provides a wide cast of not so employee of the month co workers for you to smack around  all fitting their environment beautifully  reaching the end of each part of a department allows you to take an elevator through to different parts of said department  each room having its own rewards  such as cloak stores having one cloak weapon by the end of that segment  anima deposit having anima  and so on and so forth  the ending floor for each department contains the boss or foreman for their respective part of the company  which provide a nice challenge and are plenty fun to duke it out with  the runs end when you either reach the final boss or you perish due to being overwhelmed by the power of even later common threats   b  characters humor   b   this section will be kept very brief seeing as how it s not a massive part of the game  now i will fully go on record and say in bias that  i love almost every character in the game  they re all so unique and identifiable with all their own quirks and kinks  i will fully admit however that some of the humor can be a little dry or can fall flat  but that rarely happens  the side quests are all cute and creative if you choose to read the dialogue which unfortunately i don t even see most content creators for the game do   b  problems   b   unfortunately  i can t just be bias and say the game is perfect as it is admittedly riddled with problems  to start  lets start with the more tame issues  some achievements and side stories are bugged in which they will be soft locked and inaccessible for the save file as of the most current patch  the more major changes that should definitely be looked at is how the game is balanced  the skill tree feels like there isn t too much variety in how it powers you up  though they do make you notice the difference they add to your build via the power higher tier curses gives your current run  the base game feels a tad too easy  keep in mind i am currently on breakdown 9  however i am aware that after 10 it becomes exceedingly unfair when it comes to the difficulty spike  but not impossible if you don t have an op build  all these things i expect to be fixed though seeing as the game has only been out for little over one singular month  yet people expect the world from a new developing team not used to creating games   b  big note   b   single handedly the biggest issue is ironically enough the devs  i don t want to give them too much hate nor unneeded critique when as a whole they did great for a first release  however their willingness to change their games vision just to appease angry  fans  needs to be looked at and addressed  i am more then glad that they are so responsive and willing to make needed changes  but when you start say lowering the skill ceiling as well as the skill floor  you start to get a game that ends up being way too easy  for a rougelite rougelike  that s a pretty blatant flaw that could cause even players who sink several hours into the game  could cause them to grow disinterested       b  if any of the developers behind this game manage to be directed to this review and only need one take away from it let it be this  cooperation and response to your fans is definitely important  but don t sacrifice the choices you want to make just because you hear certain individuals whining about problems that probably didn t even need fixing in the first place  your community doesn t know what is the best way to develop your own game  take a page out of hakita s book  developer of hit indie  ultrakill    b       b  conclusion   b     there s so much more i could ve gone on and on about  and arguably it could be for the better  but i simply wish to give you insight from someone who s played the game a good amount  and is looking from a perspective of a game in a very early stage of its life that can still change drastically if needed to  if i ever feel like making a follow up review or state of the game discussion  you will most likely find me in the game s community center  for potential buyers of the game  i must recommend it  it s cheap  fun  and a great game you can fit into your schedule with the shortest runs only lasting about half an hour  finally to the people who have complaints like  spoiler  the secret boss takes my gear wahhhhhhh too hard waaaaaaah  you don t have to fight her every run bozos  just make a good scythe defense build when you do go to fight her and whatever the hell you want for every other type of normal run  it s not a design flaw  the only one here is you    spoiler    i hope you enjoyed this albeit not very in depth review of the game  but hopefully it should suffice and lead to more conversation and thinking about what s actually good for the game vs people who deter new players when they cant even

the gaps in between the wait  murders on the yangtze river is the newest who dun it murder mystery game with heavy influences to said franchise  but it also manages to establish an identity of its own through a cute artstyle  rich descriptions of chinese culture and a style of pacing that helps the structure of each of it s 6 cases feel unpredictable it s not just ace attorney that influenced this game  yangtze river is clearly appreciative of all sorts of murder mysteries  taking the time to detail a rigid unlock able glossary detailing murder methods  court systems  autopsy methods and more  the studio also constantly takes the time to mention great detective novels of the past like holmes and uses china s fascination of murder mystery in the early 20th century to set the tone for several of the games characters  there is a true love of the craft here and that s just great to see as such the murders the player will discover feel rather well crafted in terms of complexity and structure  cases 3 and 4 particularly used some neat tricks that may have the potential to rival some of the great murder mystery games out there for some  the downside is that omegames studio possesses such an intelligent grasp of murder  forensics and history  that if often lets itself get over immersed in the smaller details behind how many things can happen that it runs the risk of alienating the player to the simple executions of its actual crimes  it also doesn t use visual aids as often as it should to help show the player exactly how these crimes are being committed  as such there were a few cases when i only understood about 90  of what actually had happened by the end  and while we ll touch on this later  the translation itself also doesn t do the game any favors when these moments happen also while the murders are interesting  the grander narrative that this game tries to build  while leading to an interesting place  feels like it constantly gets derailed by other unrelated cases on the way  only really building the details of its larger narrative by the games final two chapters and without feeling like there was enough setup to make the payoff feel as great as it could  still  the ride to the conclusion will still be worth taking  although it seems likely that the team would like to create a sequel to continue furthering its characters speaking of which  while shen  ah fu and wen k e are certainly leads worth rooting for  the supporting cast sometimes feel like they lack the same eccentric personalities that you ll find in aa or danganronpa that can often keep you from connecting or caring about them as much because often times  these supporting characters will feel like no more than cogs in the machine of a murder mystery  here to deliver one fact and then be gone for good  it would be nice if the game took a page from ah fu  who is easily the games strongest character  to get more characters to pop  still  the games not without a handful of good ones  and in one instance a cases twist actually bummed me out because i found that i cared more than i realized  the only other thing worth noting is a plot device of shen s character that is hinted at throughout the story that in my opinion goes absolutely nowhere and is easily the most disappointing part of his character the art style is very much its own  reminding me of the cutesy looking characters from something like a vanillaware game with a much smaller budget  when the game uses its models to depict crime reenactments i find the style to be at its best as the models almost feel like toys playing out the crime  the artwork for the close ups is also good  and occasionally takes aa influence to give repeat animations for characters like ah fu smiling  or looks of agony when an incriminating piece of evidence is presented to a suspect  you won t find anything close to a classic breakdown sadly  the music is also good but may lack a showstopping track that you ll want to play over and over  though the  objection  theme and the studios take on a  cornered  theme definitely come close the logic and gameplay itself are also quite good  while tyrion cuthbert  an indie game from last year borrowed heavily from the original aa trilogy  yangtze takes a closer approach to something like the spin off duology ace attorney investigations  keeping you  for most of the game anyways  out of court  closely examining crime scenes  interrogating suspicious people and even occasionally solving some light puzzles like measuring out a liquid formula  or connecting a series of light switches  in fact while you will cross examine people several times  you may be surprised to find that it doesn t happen quite as often as you might expect  this keeps the game play variety rather fresh and often times a game play sequence won t even repeat itself  it s certainly one of the more varied murder mysteries out there  the logic itself while not impossible to follow  will require a fair amount of brute forcing and in one instance a puzzle that required me to pick out multiple pieces of evidence at once to theorize how a murder device was created  tipped me over to my only use of a guide  or since one doesn t exist at the time of this review a community post   stick with it however  and you ll appreciate the variety  however perhaps the extra brute forcing came from the games biggest problem  while this game is certainly worth your time  if english is the only language you speak  then a rather muddy translation may stifle your ability to get full appreciation from the stories largest moments  it s a problem that goes beyond simple grammatical errors and punctuation  character names change from basic english names  to their best translated chinese names randomly throughout the story making it often difficult to keep track of which characters are being referred to  sometimes the game will refer to the protagonist as chung shen and other times john  sometimes his assistanat ah fu will be referred to as franklin and the player is just left to interpret who it is  that the game is referring to  on top of this  when details are left to the specifics  the translation can often struggle to fully explain what it s trying to say  i recall multiple instances of a murderers motive being difficult to understand through the translation because sometimes the lines just don t flow like the proper spoken english language  characters will speak about the person they are speaking to as though they are not even there very often  words will double up on themselves  and sometimes i just flat out have no idea what the game is trying to say   also i encountered a single line of untranslated dialogue in the second case   it is far from a deal breaker as one can still understand the gist of the story and reach the end without many problems  but the lack of polish in the translation will keep some from being fully immersed  and probably kept this from being a truly memorable experience that i ll be playing over and over  this is a small team who have indicated from the start if players detect any problems they should let them know  while i feel that the issues with translation may go beyond simply identifying key errors and realistically could benefit from an enhanced translation altogether  to speak on this any further would be insensitive to the level of passion that was clearly put into this game murders on the yangtze river is not the best indie murder mystery game i ve played but it is definitely one of the most passionate ones  if you can t get enough of murder mysteries then the games 15 16 hours of sleuthing will be a worthy addition to any ones murder mystery collection   just be prepared to deal

gave me the feeling that if you own too many seimeigan in your inventory  the medicine to restore your health  it is when the entity curses you in real life  with the suffering of being stuck  either in wardrobes  chests or a room which you cannot abandon  since evil in these cases does not roam free  it is just camping on your spot  menacing with stealing your fair share of vital space and being the threat of popping your safety bubble i kept stealing coins only to be able to take a breather playing old games with a pachinko vibe  d  so  maybe i deserved that fate all along oh  well    if hell is awaiting me after this  i think i ve trained enough for the upcoming challenges hiding up ahead  h1 regarding the gameplay  h1 the set up of this game such as the environments  storytelling and the way the player is guided through this journey will have you trying to fight the chills running down your spine more times than my hamster heart probably could stand it in real life some scenes at the beginning felt like the tapes from  the ring   and they were really intriguing and made my brain s gears turn in an unstoppable loop trying to take in all the details  if that could be useful information about the upcoming events or to try connecting dots of the plot unfolding some of the puzzles along the way have lore of their own  to keep adding more intrigue and eerie feelings to the game   spoiler i particularly loved the puzzle with the scrolls and the poem narrating the story of the princess   spoiler  and how that was well integrated with the rest of the general story afterward mysterious rooms are scattered throughout the building  acting as a safe point  this game saves progress automatically or through the aforementioned safe points  and those rooms can even be used a bit more than that  given the situations you might be encountering this game has some hidden references throughout all its extensions  and some of them can even grant you an achievement or two a feature i truly didn t expect was the ability to look back quickly   using the mouse wheel   which gave me more goosebumps than i was already suffering and an eerie feeling taking all over me    yep  i m stupid enough to look back while being chased non stop  my actions didn t grant me a happy ending so i do not highly recommend doing that  h1 things i would like to highlight  h1  list    great voice acting   amazing environments and puzzle designs   appealing and well scripted plot   easy mechanics  you can even take peeks from corners and look behind you while running  do not recommend doing the latest  though    more than one ending   mastering hide and run  because you won t be seeking anything more than keep breathing at this point    you can play 1980s japanese games  i almost get killed more than i would like to admit because i ve spent too much time on the variants of pachinko   list  h1  the thing with silkworms  you know  even if they could leave their cocoons  they have no mouths to eat  and their wings do not fly  they simply lay their eggs and perish   h1  quote please follow  url https   store steampowered com curator 44684285   trust witchy  url   if you

do most of the  negative   reviews  but hear me out  because the end of this review proves i ve actually played this title more than most  and i m just getting started       0 o     what  20 2  of players beat malika   and only 13 1  of players defeated big bertha  these are little  mini  bosses literally found easily by just wondering around  10 2   of players customized every slot in their inventory  and roughly an average of 45  of players actually did      well  anything  and i m not kidding  only 42  of players even beat act iii  literally most of my achievements clearly show that nobody s really even given this game a chance in it s current state and that s truly mind boggling to me  tldr  if you buy this game  play it  explore it  kill everything  and if you like these kind of games  i guarantee you re gonna dig it i bought this game during alpha ea  and this was like 2016  2017  idk it s been a minute brah  at the time  i was grinding hundreds of hours in grim dawn  and i was extremely critical of wolcen  in fact  i put maybe 6 hours in and decided there was no way it was going to be worth my time  beautiful  but not worthy my time  here i am a few years later  and i actually gave this game a shot  i sat down and started a new game  things had obviously changed  there was an entirely new introduction to the game  and it s not all  hand holdy  about it  it s story driven  and straight forward  i actually completed the introoduction and before you know it i d put a good few hours into it  i ended that first session after all these years honestly quite surprised  i called it a night and wondered if i d pick it up again  well     i did  and here i am a few days wasted later  and 31 5 hours in  and i have just completed chapter 3  i can honestly say i enjoyed this more than i enjoyed grim dawn  diablo  poe  and titan quest  i cannot stress enough how critical of this game i was  just like everyone else  but i can honestly say that looking up as i write this review to see  mixed  reviews across the board  i m a bit dumb founded tbh  the game plays like a dream  i ll share spec s below  but just take my word for it  my machine is a monster   i lock fps at 100 and it never waivers  the fact that i can just change weapons and respec my build on the fly for a 100  different game experience is incredibly appealing to me  offline play  the only experience i care about  the fact i can play this offline is a huuuuuuuuuuge deal  eat donkey sh    blizzard  no microtransactions  what   holy crap  you ve got to be kidding me  that alone deserves a positive review  but i ll continue  the skill tree system is similar to any other  like grim dawn  poe  ect  ect  those who say  the skill tree doesn t seem to do anything  clearly don t comprehend basic mathematics  moving on  the visuals  are just spot on man  the animations are gorgeous  the environment and geography are varied and vibrant  the mob types are detailed and interesting  the armors are cool  i might add not all of them make you look like a grim reaper  some of them legit make you feel like you re actually a good guy bonus points   i should note  this entire review is based on a single playthrough  with a single playstyle  and i m already eager to try out another character  but i m too caught op in getting chapter iv finished to worry about a new character at this time  the story was solid  and i skipped like 50  of it  look  i m just trying to kill stuff right now mkay   but i still managed  spite skipping a ton of dialogue  to get attached to the main trio  i can t imagine how mind blown i d of been if i d of invested into every line of dialogue  it is well written  and captivating  look  i get the hate  ea was like any other  and the dev team got hammered like all the others  the project seemed to have gone sour  and yada yada blah blah  but this product  this one right here  it s worth your money if you enjoy these kinds of games  it s made it to my favorites list  and the only reason it doesn t sit above grim dawn is because steam organizes alphabetically  no joke  i will remember this game  and i look forward to many more hours of saving the world  edit  update on act iv     i don t think i ve ever hung on the edge of feeling  overwhelmed  in so long  jeeeeeeeeeesus act iv hits the spot man  i just completed a mission that took me 4 different attempts and revisions in spec to accomplish and it was the most grafitying experience i ve had in an arpg  it wasn t just the action  it was the way the mission played out  and this is just one of these missions  there have been so many good ones that really start making you feel hopeless  and then just in that last stretch of  i ma just give up  i can t handle this today  you manage to figure something out that gets you that last little stretch to the finish line  the satisfaction of dealing with literal hordes of enemies and finally overcoming  oh yeah it s good  here s a tip i found to help you with gear  if you get through a really hard mission  i ve only done this once   before returning to town  backtrack the entire mission  not only will you find a more laid back experience  cleaning up   and you ll need the time to breath  trust me  but i encountered like 10 of the golden beetles in doing so  and earned me several legendary s  don t be in a rush to return to town after completing a mission  you will be rewarded for your pateince hands down  best experiences i ve had in a very  very long time when it comes to an arpg edit  i m now nearly 65 hours deep  my eldest child and my wife now own the game  and i have had a chance to experience multiplayer  it  has been a good experience  but i can clearly tell why many are upset about the  state  of the game  single player  offline  mode is primo  but multiplayer is indeed full of bugs  dungeon entrances not rendering so instead sometimes you see the  logic  bubble that acts as the door  instead of what should be a cave or a door entrance sometimes you get black screen and have to return to the main menu and rejoin  nothing that personally has altered my opinion of the game in any way  it s still hands down the most fun i ve ever had with an arpg  edit  some 74 hours in i m now one of the 2 2  of players actually beat the final boss and the 1 9  of players who stuck around to finish the chapter  like 10 extra minutes ffs    ever  if you aint beat it  you haven t given it an honest chance  or and honest review  p s  i was wrong  act 4 takes about as long to beat as each of the previous chapters  it s play style was a nice change of pace and i enjoyed it thoroughly  this concludes my honest review of wolcen v1 1 7 16 system specsarch linuxamd ryzen 9 5950xrtx 4090 24gb oc

roguelite game set on a horizontal playing field  here s some basic information  h1  game details   h1  olist     turn based  but almost everything you do with cause you a turn  moving  changing direction  adding an attack to queue  actually attacking will all cost one turn  enemies will take this chance to perform the same actions as you do with one exception  they have to announce an attack before actually attacking     the battle field is on a horizontal line  enemies must have a line of sight of you before they can attack  this means that  if another guy is standing between you and the other enemy  the enemy at the back will only attack after the guy in front is gone  of course enemies can still creep up behind your back so in most cases  you will only have two attacking parties simultaneously     you  and the enemies  have lots of tools at your disposal  close melee  far melee  ranged attacks  movement attacks  even magic  your skills have cooldown so more powerful skills might need more turns before they can be used again     each map location consists of around 3 minion fights   1 boss fights  between each fights  you get a random item or a random skill or a random upgrade chance  upgrade can sometimes be simply rewarding  e g   damage   cooldown  etc   or a double edged sword like  4 cooldown but also  1 damage  between each map location you can visit a shop to buy and upgrade stuff  note that there are different types of shops which specialize in damage  defense  cooldown  magic    and so on  the shops also sell active and passive items  active items are stuff like hp potion  passive items are like relics which grant you passive buffs like  1 damage when facing the back of an enemy     different character with different play styles  characters in this game have different starting cards and each character has its own unique skill  this skill is usually movement based  for example  the starting character allows you to swap position with the enemy you are facing  this can help you evade an attack at the same time causing enemies to friendly fire on each other  this skill has a cooldown as well     beating bosses rewards you with a currency to unlock more slots in the stores and unlock more starting cards   olist  h1  the good stuff   h1  olist     this game allows you to browse information on all the skills you and the enemies have  in general  b  you   b  have the full control of the battlefield  any mistakes you made are solely your fault  this makes the game feels a bit fair  of course when facing a new enemy sometimes it might be too late when they pull out a quite powerful skill and you found that you don t have turns left to react properly  that s why sometimes it is rewarding to play defensive or prepare to stay agile instead of going full offensive      multiple characters to choose from which plays quite different from each other  each character also have their own progression known as  days  with increased difficulty  so there is replay value     art style is on point   olist  h1  the okay stuff   h1  olist     the tutorial is just simple diagrams with shapes  you need to figure out most of the stuff yourself in the first one or two runs  some people like this direction but as a tactical game i think it is a good idea to lay everything out at the get go     a run is quite short currently with only 4 5 bosses  obviously this is just ea and the devs have already laid out a roadmap for updates with new maps and characters and quests  so putting this as neutral only  a run on day 1 currently is around 20 30 mins     no second chances xd  i mean  if you quit the game after a bad turn  you will load up your game back to the exact moment you rage quitted  so be prepared to face the consequences of the bad decisions you made xd   olist  h1  the bad stuff   h1  olist     the game can be a bit unfair before you have more skills unlocked  now i think most games start off like that  but i feel like for this type of game  this is actually a bad trait  for example  in action roguelikes  you can always compensate lack of equipment upgrades with user skill  albeit more difficult  the user can always come out victorious by evading the attack  in this game  you might not have the tools to overcome situations at first when you are overwhelmed by different types of enemies  this brings me to the next point     upgrades between fights are luck based  you can reroll with currency but it only rerolls the sub category not the main category  for example  you rolled a card upgrade chance to  4 cooldown and  1 damage  you use around 1 5 of your money  usually  to reroll and you will only get variants like  1 damage   1 cooldown  you cannot roll this into a  pick a new skill  category or other category   or maybe it can but i never experienced it   this means you cannot plan your journey tactically  i think if this game allow choosing of upgrade path  like hades  still rolling randomly but you always get a choice from a few options   the player can choose which path to focus on     text can be hard to read sometimes especially chinese characters  i am playing on deck and some text are compressed which is hard on the eyes   olist all in all  with the relatively low price  shogun showdown is a very entertaining roguelite suitable for short 30 minute runs  recommended

completing the main plot  clocking in around 50 hours  as of this writing i have not read other reviews or interpretations of the plot yet  b tl dr  b    i give this a 8 out of 10 my feeling is that this game was highly ambitious  and tried to be very many things   an action adventure game where you can fight or use stealth  a resource gathering   crafting game  a non linear storytelling game  a puzzle solving game with a very unique twist  a parable about the tragedies of the  real world  chernobyl incidentthere s also a branching skills tree  which lets you skill up your combat  exploration   resource gathering and crafting abilities finally  there s a heist mini game at the climax that is interwoven with the non linear story telling and uses this to create the puzzle solving aspect of the game to the makers  credit  i feel that they pulled off most of these different things pretty well and composed them into a fairly cohesive whole  but i feel the feature diversity means the game is not outstanding at any of these things  that said  i think it s a very enjoyable game the good   great visuals  everything looks very good in my opinion   engrossing story  i was extremely curious about what was actually going on with the plot fairly early on  mild spoiler   spoiler we never get full answers  because some of what s going on is basically beyond human comprehension  but most of what is going on are explained in broad strokes  spoiler   i feel like everything in the story of chernobylite is something i ve seen somewhere else to some degree  but i feel like it was all assembled in a cleverly new way   voice acting   i played with english voices   these people conveyed emotion and really make each of them distinct and relatable   i m talking main   pivotal characters here   most of the side npcs are understandably not as unique or well acted   human ai foes sound great too  though they  probably understandably  repeat the same lines a lot   interesting ai opponents  they react to dead bodies  use cover intelligently  react to sounds nearby  and so forth  they don t make either stealth or brute force approaches easy until you can craft the most devastating gear  still  they still have some stereotypical mob ai flaws and you can use this against them  they level up as you do  getting better weapons and armor  but at the end you easily outclass most of them when you can control how the engagement starts  overall  great work here  imo the not as good   there s a  i lot  i  of dialogue  and while you can fast forward through it  you can t skip it  the majority of the story and background is issued this way  if you aren t the type to stop and listen and or read what s going on  this game may not be for you  i was ok with it  but i consider myself unusually patient with things like this  i found vexing the tendency of npc vendors to force me to go through long intro dialogue every time i interact with them   too much walking   running  you walk around in large  mostly empty zones  i actually kind of enjoy that  but you do it a  i lot  i   there s a lot of holding the  move forward  control  on the upside you can skill your character up so he can run around very quickly  though this can be dangerous   but to do this you re also now holding another key button  for sprint  for long periods of time   the branching skill tree doesn t require a lot of planning except some tactical decisions about what you could best use at a given moment of training  it s easy to eventually max out all the branches   the non linear story branching   heist puzzle interaction reduces replay value  since you can probably modify a single play through to see what all the important branches do  this can be seen as a good thing too  though  hr   hr on that note    while trying to avoid spoilers  the non linear story  i is  i  the puzzle  let me explain  you have to make a lot of branching decisions in the game  you initially think these decisions matter for straightforward purposes of building  and retaining  a team of companions for the endgame heist  you see  your companions have wildly different and sometimes very conflicting personalities  making it a challenge to balance how they collectively react to your choices  choosing to make one teammate happy can anger another one  and they will leave if you make them too unhappy  there s a game mechanic i won t go into details on  because spoilers  that actually lets you revisit the past and change prior decisions  the implementation here is impressive   the system understands how decisions interact  and dependent  downstream decision branches can be affected or entirely removed by your changes initially i didn t understand why this was included  it is given an in game lore explanation  in a very science fiction hand wave kind of way   but i didn t understand why the developers gave players access to such a mechanism instead of the usual option to simply replay the game in order to make different decisions  i thought maybe they were just catering to completionists then i got to the heist  and learned that  for a perfect heist   i a number of your earlier decisions are utterly critical  i   the ability to change past decisions to make the heist go well  b is  b  the puzzle aspect of the game  you are extremely unlikely to make all the  right  decisions in your first pass  even if you have been revisiting them to better balance your team  you have to think really hard about sometimes obscure clues or blindly experiment with changing your past decisions much earlier in the game to get a  perfect  heist  hr   hr  b footnote   b  if you like the movie cabin in the woods  this game has a similar thing going on  in that movie  some people become aware that what we think of as horror movie tropes are required to happen in their  in movie  world for that world to exist  the implication is that the movie audiences are  to the movie characters  unknowable gods with the power to destroy everything if not appeased by the acts they perform  chernobylite can be interpreted as loosely translating this meta narrative to video games   what if game npcs were real people in some other universe who became conscious of how the main character constantly reloads saved games to try different story branches or combat tactics  what if they remembered dying and reappearing  spoiler are  we  the chernobylite   spoiler    edited for typos and clarity",2023-07-15,2023-07-15,True,77,1,0.871120810508728027,0,True,False,False

science fiction elements the player embodies igor khymynuk  a brilliant scientist turned  stalker  in search of his fianc e tatyana amalieva  modeled after the divine joanna tarasek  miss  l ska 2017   who disappeared after the chernobyl incident in 1986 igor still hears the sweet voice of his beloved  who seems to want to guide him on his journey but is this pretty familiar voice only in igor s head  or is it real the heavily irradiated  exclusion zone  between chernobyl and pripyat is your adventure playground many nar mercenaries patrol there  but what are they defending the research and mastery of chernobylite  an element with supernatural properties  is undoubtedly the key to all this mystery   the fascinating plot gives rise to a narrative rich in twists and turns your main quest is therefore to find any clue that will bring you closer to tatyana  whether laconic writings from the soviet era mentioning her  objects that belonged to her  or magnificent photos of said young lady the different secondary missions offer multiple objectives  such as stealing resources  food  medicine  ammunition  etc    helping stalkers in distress  destroying important nar equipment to harm their activities and many other things the quests are not linear  you can choose to play the missions in the order you want each important objective achieved will make you progress in the main plot throughout his adventures  igor will ally himself with companions of fortune  other stalkers each having their own history  their own motivations  and their own character  which makes them endearing and unique ensure their good health  their morale  that they have good equipment and maintain good relations with you your allies are precious  like family  like brothers in arms  and can bring back food and tools during their excursions in the zone these supplies are always useful  and show that the cohesion of the group is good be careful however  certain missions require a choice on your part  to be carried out with your soul and conscience they can have serious consequences for the rest of the adventure certain choices will please one of your teammates more  to the detriment of another   who knows if the future will allow you to repair your mistakes after a long day of mission in the zone  there s nothing like a little rest the atmosphere becomes more relaxed and warm in igor s base  which is initially nothing other than an old storage warehouse in your post apocalypic  home sweet home   you will have to create everything necessary for the survival and comfort of your team you will need something to produce food  make treatments  build weapons   you will have to ensure that the radioactivity is as low as possible  that the air is breathable  that you do not run out of electricity   all this is necessary for the good health of your teammates and yourself  who must maintain healthy morale to move forward like any stalker  you re also a scavenger you will spend a lot of time collecting everything that comes within your reach  in order to recycle them to improve your base and your equipment  collect everything you can  chemicals  fuel  electronic components  plants  mushrooms   everything will sooner or later have a use  nothing is lost  everything is transformed remember to carefully organize your inventory before wandering around the zone indeed  the nar patrol in the area and an armed confrontation can quickly ensue  and they re not alone  mysterious creatures are there too   you will need to be well equipped to survive in this radioactive green hell craft weapons  ammo  armor  gas mask  anti radiation potions  health kits  alcohol   a well stocked and meticulously organized inventory is the key to the perfect survivalist some wandering merchants allow you to exchange certain equipment for others your pda also allows you to measure the radiation rate and scan the surroundings to find resources and equipment you also have a homemade portal gun  powered by chernobylite  allowing you to return to your base once your mission is done don t expect to find a plethora of weapons in such an place the weaponry is quite basic  you can obtain a revolver  a makarov pistol  an ak 47  of course    a shotgun  a crossbow  but you can also craft experimental weapons  very practical and powerful each weapon is customizable  you can personalize them as you wish  by adding a sight or a scope  changing the trigger  modifying the barrel  choosing a better magazine  and even a skin if you have the appropriate dlcs  as you complete missions  you will earn skill points  in order to acquire numerous advantages for your character  each of your squad members can teach you their specialties  you will be able  among other things  to be more discreet  aim more precisely  have more health  etc   the graphics of chernobylite are sublime and very detailed the lights and environments are magnificent in fact  the developers of the farm 51 went so far as to 3d scan the zone and its surroundings  to provide as much realism as possible if the tragic events that occurred in 1986 retained an immense enigmatic aura  the designers knew how to perfectly combine realism and mystery in the chernobyl and pripyat zone  where nature has reclaimed its rights  the atmosphere is gloomy  sinister but strangely charming the atmosphere is heavy and disturbing  but there is no doubt that it will captivate you in addition to the abundant amount of forests  you will have the opportunity to venture into residential areas of brutalist architecture  military bases  scientific complexes  and many other places popular with fans of urban exploration  all this will bring you closer to the chernobyl nuclear power plant  responsible for this infamous disaster the weather is also changeable  the weather can sometimes be sunny  foggy  rainy   but beware of chernobylite storms   during these powerful storms  causing green forest fires  a mysterious  black stalker  arrives via a portal with the sole aim of destroying you at all costs  you will either have to fight him and hurt him enough so that he runs away on his own  or run away from him and hope that he loses track of you   but it will come back to haunt you  again and again  every day that god makes  with every chernobylite storm   the original soundtrack composed by miko aj stroi ski is a work of art it is composed of soft and pleasant ambient music with calm  mysterious and strange tones the ost wonderfully enhances the very special aura that emanates from the zone chernobylite is a pure masterpiece mixing fps  rpg  exploration and survival  like its illustrious ancestor s t a l k e r  the game is exciting  the plot thrilling  the atmosphere gloomy but with a very captivating

i love this game i highly recommend  b against  b  coming into this game expecting a dating sim  where dating simulators are usually trivial in difficulty and sparse in gameplay  and where all the love for the game is put into character relationships alone  potionomics stands out in also having an addictive and well tuned gameplay loop that actually  b challenges  b  the player  this is  first and foremost  a simulator of a witch fresh out of university with a bachelor s in potion making being flung into a million dollar debt  so expect your time with the game to be  i less  i  than smooth sailing  h1 highlights   h1  list     the art is gorgeous  all of it  it genuinely surprises me that this level of quality came out of a studio s first game  the 2d sprites  the card art  guis  backgrounds of scenes  potions and their ingredients  the 3d sprites  chiefly the 12 fully modeled and detailed bodies of the friends you ll meet  and the 5 antagonists who have just as pleasing designs despite their screentime  the music  by far my favourite part of this game  with perfectly fitting songs that sound like cotton candy to the ears  being so diverse in discography but expertly relaying the aesthetic of each moment  i ve added several of the game s tracks to my playlist at this point     the gameplay loop feels psychologically engineered to be as satisfying as possible  it s a holy trinity     the slow and calculative but scrappy process of making a potion  sometimes requiring a calculator to figure out the best combination of the ingredients currently at your disposal  followed by the exhilarating task of selling the potion  which keeps the player toeing the line between low stress and high profits  leading to very rewarding sales at the expense of sustained damage  high stress   then followed by the relaxing process of running daily errands to sylvia s business partners and friends  taking a breather and hanging out with them  all tied up within a time management mechanic that keeps the player vigilant and dissuades simply turning off one s brain when not chatting with characters    this gameplay loop ensures the player does not burn out or get bored of the game  always juggling activities and never overstaying its welcome    the love interests are all grounded and have realistic flaws that make them so human and relatable  it s impossible to choose any one partner as  b all  b  of them are charming in their own way   oh also they re queer  and one of them is even enby    the worldbuilding is fun and unique  and is very polished  rafta  the island and setting of the game  is explored by characters in such a riveting show don t tell manner that gives the island its own identity that you re encouraged to interpret your own way  list  h1 lowlights   h1 you ll notice that all the complaints are regarding gameplay  list    this game is  ironically  not at all suited for its perceived target audience  dating sim players  as someone who got into this game for its deck building and not the relationships  i found the experience incredibly fun  the juxtaposition between the stressful gameplay and the relaxed relationship building was what kept me from ever feeling even the slightest tinge of dullness  but i know that s not what a lot of people want  every 10 days is a competition against the arc s main antagonist  and unlike other stardew  or animal crossing likes  this is  b mandatory   b  failure means you  b lose  b   and you can either redo the fight or send yourself back to a past save  but you  b cannot  b  progress  again  this is a debt simulator first    as a consequence of this  the game panders to no one with its difficulty  while there is a low skill floor and high skill ceiling in haggling for good prices on potions  which is good  competitions are in an awkward place where dating sim players are crushed by how hard bosses are  whereas deckbuilding players find competitions too easy to be notable  this could easily have been solved with difficulty settings  which this game desperately needs considering the sheer disparity between its audiences    this is devastating   b there is no endgame    b once you beat the fifth and final competition on day 50  the game is  b over   b  if you hadn t completed all of the characters  relationships  whoopsie  guess all you can do is go back to a save you made 20 hours ago to more rigorously gift your friends  want to keep making money  test your deck s upper limit  nope  best you can do is the final fight that you sweep without even having to haggle anyway  want to max out your potion making pots and barrels  nah  should ve done that before the competition  if i were to rate this game out of 10  this fact  b alone  b  would knock the score down 1 point    list the reviews here are very mixed  so i would recommend buying potionomics and trying it yourself for about an hour  i am  b certain  b  that you ll find the artwork and audio to your tastes  but its gameplay is admittedly an acquired taste  if you don t enjoy the gameplay loop then refund it  but if you do  you re about to have one of the best and most novel dating sim  b and   b card game

the translators are working on cleaning those up   it s currently a couple steps above most mtl wuxia novels in terms of translation quality   i ll give some tips for those that decide to try it  if you break your leg from falling or get loaded with ailments  go to a clinic and lay in a sickbed  one of the white beds   the doctor will eventually come over to you to ask what you need  then you pick a dialogue option to pay for healing your ailments or broken leg   side note  if one of your pets gets a broken leg  i have yet to find a way to get the doctor to heal it   instead  you want to build affinity with the doctor  and practice with making potions and whatnot at the crucible until you are able to get the inner karma  golden acupuncture   then you activate that inner karma  and anytime you put chi into an acupoint  any ailments directly surrounding the acupuncture point are healed   far as i can tell  that s the only way to heal such things  though there might be consumables that can do it that i have yet to encounter  start taming animals early  they can be a pain to lug around at times  but they can help immensely in battle   careful with your horse and high places  mine loves to break his legs due to moving too fast while up high  try to tame the  boss  animals  such as the big monkey  big dog  etc   while you can boost up the base versions of the animals  the boss animals are several times stronger from the start  and yet cost the same thing to tame   edit 10 6 23 i think there s also an upper limit to how far you can tame the base versions of animals   my normal monkey has eaten hundreds of pinecones and is still around 1k vigor  while my big dog has over 5k vigor and there s no sign of stopping   so keep that in mind as well  tame a monkey early  big or not   if you lose a battle  the monkey can pick you up and take you to the clinic  sometimes even causing you to avoid being captured killed   be aware  if you re heavy  the monkey will be very slow  as they have to take on all your load with you  if you want some advice on making money  keep in mind you can just exchange with any npcs at all  with base resources   the auction works well for bulk selling base materials as well    if you re like me  you may spend waaaay too long trying to figure out what  production experience  is and how to get it      it s not something you get from producing a lot  it s a physical item that you have to buy   check counters at shops  they sometimes have them there   same deal for weaving experience  forging experience  etc    as the game doesn t really explain it to you for some reason  the sneak key is  g    i didn t know for a few hours   be very aware that people will kill you if you steal from them if they don t know you well  as a streamer i watch  tomato  found out the hard way    when you beat a human enemy   take relic  takes their head off  killing them   not advised to do that to anyone who isn t a bandit  as it will likely cause entire factions to hunt you    get a skill that heals you in battle   self explanatory  really   some enemies i ve found have 4000  vigor  and i don t even want to think about how long it ll take to get to that point myself   they ll wear you down through attrition alone if you can t heal   a defensive skill such as the golden bell one is also pretty much required to survive the biggest attacks and skills    if you badly need help  grind up some money and request a commission for a strong npc   you ll be paying them to bodyguard you  and it can make some battles a breeze    be advised you are still the primary combatant  so your ally  unless they pick their own fight with your enemy  will not be able to save you if you decide to poke a black serpent while you have less than 1000 vigor   you re still the one that has to take the hits  they just provide more damage    true qi  is gained by activating certain kinds of inner karma   get high enough true qi in an element  it can even prevent you getting any ailments from it at all    find the bookcase in a sect s training hall if you want to buy the sect skills  remember that  h  lets you build complete houses  they re not in the production menu   be very careful with placement  the center of the blueprint will create a statue which you have to reach to add the materials and build it   so if it s over the edge of a cliff  you ll have to do some annoying finagling with placeable stairs to get to it for now  i think that s it   there s probably more  but nothing else is coming to mind immediately   oh  right  get a ferret   they ride on your shoulder and are far too cute not to get   that is all edit 9 20 23 the qinggong ability will require you to seek out enlightenment stones to advance   however  the translation is different from what it tells you  as of when i type this anyway   the first zone especially that you need is eagle hunt platform   you ll want this earlier than when i discovered it  it gives you double jump   the other one is at the only  mirror lake  zone i ve seen   i forget the name  but it had the enlightenment stone    and poison frogs   don t be fooled by the normal name for em   that s all i ll say   eagle hunt platform is scorching  mirror lake is miasma  so prepare accordingly   edit 10 3 23 found out that you can transcribe your skills and inner kungfu if you acquire a bookcase for your own home   it makes a skill manual for it  which you can sell  but it costs money to transcribe   i have attempted giving the manuals to my children to help them out early on  but i didn t see them use them    might just not have used it yet    as above may have hinted  your children  when they come of age  will be blank slates   no inner kungfu  no skills   they can still fight other npcs with no issue  as npcs only fight each other based on vigor values  not anything else that i can discern   i say that based on how the kungfu tournament always goes   i saw two characters fight  one had merely 3 more vigor than the other  and the one with 3 less vigor always lost   not once has an npc with more vigor lost to one with less  in my experience    recruit your children to your sect as soon as you can  else if the sect they join becomes hostile  the bloody sect masters kept trying to rob me  so i kept winding up with hostile relations by not noticing until after i mangled them  that they were a sect master   it can become dangerous   killing your own kin is extremely hated    to destroy another sect  destroy their flag  and replace it with your own sect s flag   all their members will become roamers or whatever other job they may have had  and can then be recruited    as long as they don t hate your guts   be aware that the moment you start destroying their flag  the sect will attack in force   bring a team  and pets  or you re gonna have to fight everybody edit 10 6 23 don t bother trying to tame black serpents  poison frogs  or flame lizards   they re special creatures who cannot be tamed  even if the option is still there  just greyed out    beware of having multiple intimate relations  your partners will get jealous   if you console them  they will develop hysteria ailments   which you can heal to get a large boost to relations with them   fair warning  it ll be a lot of chi required    beware of having multiple children at once   you ll get nagged incessantly about the progress of each and every one of them   take it from the guy who thought it was a good idea to have 7 of them at the same time    be aware  the method to get the sage level for certain things like forging  establishment  and so on  is currently bugged   the family with the secret has no option to let you learn it  you have  talk about topics the other person likes  about 20 times to level up to sage  right now",2023-09-12,2023-10-07,True,64,0,0.863157987594604492,0,True,False,True

i saw that yamimash played it and he said that it was really really good  so i m very eager to see what is up   and that is a terrifying animatronic bear  reads off script  family pizzeria looking for security guard to work the night shift  oh  12 00 a m  the first night  if i didn t want to stay the first night  why would i stay any more than five  why would i say anymore than two   hello  okay   hello  hello   oh  ah i can t move  that s a creepy skull   there s creepy things on the wall   oh  hello   phone guy begins dialogue   hello  hello hello   hi   uh  i wanted to record a message for you  to help you get settled in on your first night   eugh    um  i actually worked in that office before you  and i m finishing up my last week now as a matter of fact  so  i know it can be a bit overwhelming    euuagh     but i m here to tell you  there s nothing to worry about   agh    you ll do fine  so  let s just focus on getting you through your first week    okay  sounds go   ah  let s see  first there s an introductory greeting from the company that i m supposed to read   i it s kind of a legal thing  you know  ahm    welcome to freddy fazbear s pizza   okay     a magical place for kids and grownups alike    mark wheezes indistinctly in the background  heheha      where fantasy and fun come to life   eugha      freddy fazbear entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person  upon discovering that damage or death has occured  a missing person report will be filed within ninety days or as soon as property and premises had been thoroughly cleaned and bleached  and the carpet s have been replaced   blah blah blah   now that might sound bad  i know  but   yeah    there s really nothing to worry about  uh  the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night  but do i blame them  no  if i was forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years  and i never got a bath  i d probably be a bit irritable at night too  so just remember  these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children  and you need show them a little respect  right   okay    okay   ha okay   so just be aware  the characters fo tend to wander a bit   nehaheugh   they re one some kinda of free roaming mode   hehauhuhugh   uhh   something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for two long   oohoohoo   uh  they used to be allowed to walk around during the day  too  but then there was the bite of eighty seven   the bite      yeah    what bite    it s amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe   why    now concerning your safety  the only real risk to you as the night watch here  if any  is the fact that these characters   if they happen to see you after hours  they probably won t recognize you as a person   oh  oh   they ll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without it s costume on  now  since that s against the rules here at freddy fazbear s pizza  they ll probably try tooo   forcefully stuff you inside a freddy fazbear suit   oh  i get it   uhm  now that wouldn t be so bad if the suits themselves weren t filled with cross beams  wires  and animatronic devices   augh    especially around the facial area   uh huh    now you can imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those can cause a bit of discomfort   yeah    or death   uh  the only parts of you that would get to see the light of day would be your eyeballs and teeth that pop out of the front of the mask   euah  oh  why  what happened   now  they didn t tell you these things when you signed up  but hey  first day should be a breeze  i ll chat with you tomorrow  uh   check those cameras and remember to close the doors  but only if absolutely necessary   that s not good

vectors  dice and dual damage  the dice bit offers variety in the way one would expect  when you add a card to a deck  you just have the effect of that card  when you add a six sided die  you have potentially six unique outcomes  generally you have a range of  good  and  bad  outcomes  spread across three dice archetypes of safe  balanced  and risky  with the intensity of  good  outcomes increasing in proportion to the frequency of  bad  ones  now this is where the dual damage aspect comes in  in astrea  there are damage types of purity and corruption  purity heals you and harms enemies  while corruption harms you and heals enemies  where the intricacies of the two systems meet is in the benefits of using corruption  the usual  bad  outcome of rolling your dice  to your advantage  every character in astrea has access to a virtue system which allows them to take certain actions after their health passes below a certain value  by using corruption on yourself  you can activate these virtues more often  and can even use them multiple times per turn if you take corruption  purify yourself  and then corrupt yourself below a certain value again  this system marvelously blends the  good   bad  aspects of dice with the dual damage system  allowing you a large amount of flexibility in how you progress through your turns  maybe that risky die you picked didn t land on a purity face  but that corrupt face can still be used to your advantage  or maybe you don t want to corrupt yourself and want to feed it to an enemy instead  albeit with the side effect of healing them and possibly making them retaliate   as you progress deeper into the game  you will gain access to more complex dice and more ways to bring out their true potential  one such way is through acquiring blessings  which provide passive benefits to your character  some of these blessings may provide even more incentive to corrupt enemies  making the choice to embolden their corruption all the more tantalizing  even with the risk that they might over corrupt and let loose a harmful effect  other blessings may bolster the naturally beneficial aspects of your dice  while some may completely change the way that you play a character  you may also find sentinels  robotic friends that journey beside you and carry their own unique dice  these friends may bolster your capabilities  or you can choose to build around them to empower their own  it is this depth of choice and the plethora of playstyles available to the player that make playing astrea so satisfying and invoke the well known thought of  just one more run         graphics themes   astrea features beautifully crafted 2 d characters and environments along with a  paper doll  style of animation  which together invoke the feeling of gazing into a living storybook  this art also carries the game s purity vs  corruption theme through its palette  presenting gorgeous shades of blue that gradually blend into red as your eyes shift from your own side of battle to the corrupted soil your enemies stand upon  there s an extra level of satisfaction to winning a difficult fight when you get to see those crimson hues shift into celestial blues and cyans when you purify your opponent  the colors chosen are also quite soft  making gameplay easy on the eyes  which is to the player s benefit when they are up at 4 am playing their 20th run of the night  i say this from experience       music   astrea features an engaging orchestral soundtrack  complete with live instruments  there is a large focus on ethereal sounding strings  serene in calm moments  but driving and malevolent in some of the game s later encounters  this is held atop expertly layered percussion that pulls forward feelings of exploration and whimsy  shifting in the aforementioned later fights to emotions of heroism and urgency  every song does well to capture what the player is up against at different parts of the story  and helps to increase immersion  while also providing tunes that may stick around in your head even after you put the game down for the night            conclusion  this game is a love letter to its predecessors  while also rising above them in terms of mechanics  art  and music  it feels as if prior deckbuilders were setting the foundation  and astrea is the beautiful building that was built around it  improving  adapting  adding  and expanding systems in a novel way to provide an experience that will feel unique and engaging to a variety of players  at this time of writing this  astrea is my personal 2023 game of the year  and i plan to sink hundreds more hours into it as i get to experience and go through the game again along with new players  my only hope is that anyone reading this review will come to love this game in the same way i have  as it is truly something special that i believe will be embraced and played for years to come",2023-09-22,2023-09-22,True,84,1,0.771705269813537598,4,True,False,False

system of roguelite indie deckbuilders  there s no question of who the sun is  slay the spire s rays are so blinding and its gravitational pull so strong that it s almost impossible to talk about any of the games in its orbit without first prostrating in the warmth of its glow and acknowledging some obvious comparisons astrea  six sided oracles is a celestially themed celestial body in that galaxy  you ve got deliberate turn based combat where enemies stand on the right side of the screen and telegraph their intent  you ve got a deck of dice instead of cards  but they operate under a lot of the same global deckbuilding principles  start with some weak and simple base dice then expand and replace them over the course of a forty minute to hour long ascent up a tower  much like its peers  the name of the game is thoughtful deck construction and probability manipulation  where stacking the deck  or  i guess  weighing the dice  helps bolster your odds of successfully completing a run it s addictive and fun if you re into this kind of thing  and importantly there are a few unique twists that make it more than just an astral reskin of a game you ve already played before  in fact  astrea benefits a lot from you bringing some deckbuilding knowledge with you  it almost expects you to be one of those little freaks with multiple real life days played in slay the spire due to a base level rules complexity and choice quantity that put it among the harder games in this genre even the one star difficulty beginner character they give you in the tutorial still demands a lot of strategy from you  if that s a proposition that excites you instead of scaring you  then astrea will reward you with a soft moonlit glow of its own  a deep and worthwhile deckbuilder with endless variety  tight balance  a consistently beautiful presentation  and more than enough differentiation from its evergreen peers to ensure it has a pull of its own https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3047378903everything in astrea is red  blue  or the purple in between  most of the enemies look like a thematic inversion of your characters  everything and everyone can be impacted by the red corruption  and  dying  in a run will have you turn into a freaky eldritch beast while you look at the game over screen it s not just a striking presentation motif that unifies the entire game into an elegant celestial with horror undertones aesthetic  but also a visual reinforcement of one of the games core mechanics healing and damage aren t discrete actions but two sides of the same coin purification and corruption are the two big keywords here  from a combat perspective  purification will damage enemies and heal you  and corruption does the inverse  it s an important acknowledgement because part of the games whole shtick is compulsory plays  get a bad roll on your dice and it lands on the  do big corruption  face  and you will be forced to play it it s just a matter of whether or not you d rather that big corruption damage you or heal your opponent if you ve got bad luck  fear not  the game gives you a lot of outs even if you find yourself continuously rolling snake eyes  discarding and rerolling take on new meaning in a game with risky cards like this  but importantly there are also ways you can directly manifest that corruption to help you astrea takes the concept of using your health as a resource and pushes it to the utmost extreme  there are character specific powers that exist at different health thresholds that give you powerful boons  reduce yourself to one hp on the engineer character  for example  to allow either of your turrets to use a second dice for the turn importantly  you can activate these more than once per turn if you reduce down to that threshold multiple times  take that same engineer at one hp  heal him then damage him again and you ll have his turret refresh accessible to you once more most of the time this is the ideal way to play  reinforced by the whole visual design of the game  great power comes at risk of being corrupted by it  the strongest abilities on your healthbar are typically towards the lower end of it  so you re incentivized to play scrappy and teeter back and forth at risky health thresholds instead of comfortably keeping yourself topped off at max health engaging with self damage doesn t feel bad long term either  astrea intelligently splits your health up into a more short term combat health and a long term run health  going down to one hp in a battle won t punish you for the next battle as long as you don t hit zero and lose one of your actual two to three heart pieces it s an excellent system  one that has you looking at health and damage in new ways and effectively doubling the options for every dice in the game due to their bidirectional capabilities  by itself this system could have buoyed an entire deckbuilder but in astrea it s but one of its pillars the dice are the other and they  too  add a lot of texture to the decision making  in addition to how they force you to engage with bad rolls  they add an entire new axion of how they can be evaluated  sure  the dice exist on a spectrum from good to bad and from broad to narrow  but also on a more astrea specific spectrum of  riskless to dangerous   most dice come in three variants of safe  balanced  and risky  and your most successful runs will be defined by how well you understand your current build s risk tolerance  and if you can try to use any of that risk in your favor  my first successful beating of the super duper final boss was thanks to some early run powerups that gave me both shielding and extra purification when i corrupted enemies  allowing me to make a pivot into lots of risky dice whose bad faces were now slightly less bad there are only a few areas where astrea is corrupt and in need of some purification  despite its beautiful and cohesive stellular theme  strict adherence to that theme does occasionally leave the gameplay feeling tooltip heavy  simple and universal gameplay concepts like poison  block  strength  and dozens more get dressed in cosmic appropriate relabels like relief  light shield  and serenity  even after a week s worth of runs i find myself leaning on mouseover pretty heavily to remind myself  what exactly was the difference between torment and affliction again   you really feel it thanks to the very buff and debuff heavy nature of many of the builds  and that also exacerbates astrea s dire need for an end of turn preview button  between you  your opponent  and each of your sentinels  there s frequently six participants in any given battle with their own attacks  buffs  and debuffs that spiral into rube goldberg machines of chain reactions that can take a lot of time to parse manually  a little predicted outcome option would save a lot of time in ensuring whether or not hitting the end turn button will resolve with your death https   steamcommunity

concepts into visual and gameplay metaphors for finding balance  astrea  six sided oracles is a masterful and must play deckbuilder there are few deckbuilding experiences as deep and endless as the ones provided by these six oracles  though there are many titles that have replicated slay the spire s mechanics  fewer have done so as elegantly and as transformatively as here  thanks to its endless

arcadia home  a retro futuristic metropolis filled with gaudy  extravagant architecture  greens  blues and oranges so verdant they re almost sickly  and perfect sunshiny weather 24 hours a day  seven days a week  it s an uncannily gorgeous  70s interpretation of what the future might look like  and  incidentally  the colossal set of a city wide reality tv show  in which each and every resident is

cartoonishly evil and not so subtly named walton media pulling the show s strings  the lighthearted yet astute commentary comes from a writing team that clearly knows what they re doing  and the quality is everywhere you look throughout trevor s story  the pacing is breakneck but controlled  providing a steady cadence of new information and plot developments yet giving more critical reveals room to breathe  the storytelling is meticulous  loaded with surgical foreshadowing  taking great care not to reveal the narrative s hand too early  however  leaving just enough breadcrumbs that the eventual jaw dropping rug pulls feel anything but cheap  the comedic timing is brilliant  through genius call back jokes  abrupt  almost documentary style cuts to interviews providing humourous context  and other fourth wall breaking gags that  given the overall subject matter  are as inspired as they are hilarious yet among the seemingly endless narrative strengths  the character writing trumps all  particularly in the relationship between trevor and angela  the hacker and activist working from within walton media  instigating and facilitating trevor s whirlwind extraction from his dystopian gilded cage  their witty back and forths are the heart and soul of the seven or so hour experience  angela s playful confidence juxtaposes nicely with trevor s understandably overwhelmed disposition  and their budding friendship feels as natural  authentic and believable as it is satisfying stellar voice performances round out the package  with charming and compelling renditions across the board  special mention goes to yuri lowenthal s portrayal of trevor  lowenthal s delivery of the creeping frustration seeping through the cracks of trevor s optimistic facade as he grapples with what his life has been and the severity of his predicament is so genuine  and the relatability and depth he breathes into the leading role while preserving the fundamental and intentional vapidity inherent to the character feels only possible through the marriage of a sharp script and an exceptional performance  trevor is every bit a protagonist  yet i can completely buy that the man i m watching is categorically the least interesting individual in arcadia  h3 puzzles and platforming  h3 while the narrative is a triumph in every sense of the word  gameplay isn t quite as honed  taking plenty of inspiration from inside and similar experiences  trevor is controlled in a 2 5d space  but don t expect constant puzzles or precise platforming  most of your time in arcadia will be spent holding right until the next story beat  that general lack of traditional gameplay won t be everybody s cup of tea  but it s by no means boring  the story is engaging enough on its own  and partnered with bustling backdrops and clever dialogue pacing that never leaves an empty moment  i hardly wound up missing the more action focused set pieces at all and for good reason  too  the occasional chase and stealth sequences as trevor s pursuers close in on him are  unfortunately  more frustrating than anything else  with controls made up of little more than a basic run and jump  these scenes prioritise quick thinking over motor skills  however  all that approach really ends up delivering are hard to see jumps and dubious objectives  angela does what she can to keep trevor safe through the cameras  allowing you to influence some of the electronics in the environment  but with the added complexity and any hesitation resulting in failure  these sections culminate in far too much trial and error for my liking  the last thing i want holding up the adrenaline filled climactic moments are half a dozen setbacks before i even realise what i m supposed to be doing however  they re not all out of the blue games have up their sleeve  in the lulls of trevor s escape  the perspective shifts to angela  though not by simply taking control of a new character  but also the complete transformation from a 2 5d side scroller to a first person puzzler  the brain teasers in these scenes are delightful  they re wonderfully creative and novel  a satisfying challenge  yet more than intuitive enough to prevent any stagnation in the gripping narrative https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3096508173the striking contrast between the two characters isn t just for show or the sake of it  either  i can t go into much detail without spoiling the myriad surprises  however  expect not only phenomenally inventive  one of a kind gameplay sequences facilitated by the ingenious blending of genres but also remarkable storytelling techniques that make the very best of the dual perspectives  h3 final thoughts  h3 had someone told me back in january that some bizarre amalgamation of inside  firewatch  the truman show and somehow disney s tomorrowland would end up becoming one of my favourite games of the year  i doubt i would ve believed them  however  i really can t remember the last time i was this captivated by a narrative and this blown away as it reached its conclusion  through its modern twists and inversions of its inspirations and its

game  part deck builder and it s an enjoyable experience in both cases  it s got a lot of structural similarities to some of the dorkiest cardpgs like gwent  the witcher tales and warhammer 40k space wolf  it compliments the usual roleplaying thrills of new weapons and armor with new decks and cards but it also borrows a little bit from nintendo  aside from the obvious fire emblem influence in the strategy ui  the gameboy advance in general is a named visual inspiration for the pixel art  your little pillow enemies look like the menu sprites for early gen pokemon games   a gba like simplicity can also be felt in its bubbly low stakes style and its snappy gamepad preferred control scheme  you could imagine playing this one with only a d pad and two buttons if you wanted to  though some tooltips and extras are mapped to the other keys some of the minutia of its tactics rules don t gel super well with the cards  and most stuff that happens outside of the battles feels kind of superfluous  but none of that stifles the satisfying card based progression and strategic combat that makes dream tactics worthwhile https   youtu be iim6o awcmoi m about 12 hours into an unfinished playthrough because i elected to play dream tactics on its hardcore mode with permadeath that doesn t scale down well into a short prerelease period so just keep in mind that i haven t seen the final battles or story moments here though i have seen most everything else  part of what makes dream tactics unique  and part of why i think it s particularly well suited to hardcore  is that its 5 worlds have a largely non linear structure after the tutorial difficulty tends to increase within a world rather than between them  so if you re playing on anything other than easy than your flow is usually gonna be to play a world up til you get too hard of a battle  then jump to a new world to power up experience is paced in such a way that you usually get a full level from each encounter  which gives a few passive stat bonuses and some extra equipment slots for each of your three to four party members it feels great  the balance is tight enough that the tension from a battle just too hard to relieving that tension with some deck modification or level ups is frequent  https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3223237586when you re actually in an encounter  you have simple grid movement rules but with attacks and spells that are entirely tied to your deck  the three starting characters you spend most of your time with come with decks that loosely follow mage  warrior  and stance dancing cavalry archetypes  but they re themed up to match dream tactics  silly designs the default mage deck is all about applying drowsiness to foes then spending it for damage or healing modifiers  the default warrior deck is piloted by a bunny girl  so you get all these interactions of planting and harvesting carrots in between conventional sword swings  the cavalry is all about travel distance with lots of easy access to extra mobility and ways to weaponize that mobility with squares traversed damage bonuses they re all well defined enough that they slot into roles from the start  but they re flexible enough to adapt to other styles too  not only are there plenty of cards you can pick up in the overworld  you can also splash them cross character thanks to a limited  borrow other classes  cards  budget everyone gets there s lots of strategies you can develop and they can be influenced or outright created by equipment as well  outside of the decks you can assign raw status bonuses or unique effects to each character  dimensional bomb  for example  is an equipment that helps take the sting off of misses by giving you an explosion every time you miss  in a vacuum it s just there to help you salvage bad rolls but outside of a vacuum you can combo it with cards and other equipment  like sleeping mask  that increase your chance to miss  and try to force that explosion instead there s lots of interactions like that if you look for them  and it nails that card game excitement of letting each card feel like a solution to a problem you may not have run into yet but maybe the most powerful interaction is one that sits outside of the card text  there s a small rules quirk that trivializes a lot of the encounters  and if you ve played space wolf it s a problem you may be familiar with https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3223237196card games just do not map well to strategy game  fog of war   and though there isn t exactly fog here  your enemies are beholden to something like it  there are discrete and readable aggro ranges for every enemy mob which also means you can just not walk into them until you re prepared  you can fully heal  fully buff  and  here s why it s weird with cards     just stand still and draw turn after turn until you have the perfect hand once you see that play you can t unsee it  and though many encounters will at least slightly punish this by holding timed rewards over your head many of them don t it s too ubiquitous of a strategy to be as powerful as it is  and effectively dices every major conquest into multiple small skirmishes with free resets and perfect first hands after each if you re willing to spend the time fatiguingly drawing over and over again  h2  in conclusion   h2 dream tactics comes together  its freedom to traverse worlds in any order give the game a ton of variety and make its hardcore challenge tough but not masochistic  and its new card unlocks give you a

recent years  such as coromon and 9 years of shadows  to this list of beautiful titles joins dream tactics  a video game with an aesthetic similar to the gba classics  and that amalgamates two very interesting genres  being these the tactical rpg and deck building  and i must say  it is a fantastic combination  especially because the developers have managed to make the most of this idea  with entertaining mechanics and a very extensive unit customization  with dozens of items to power up our characters  and many cards with a variety of effects  we ll have to make our way through the world of dreams in pursuit of defeating a terrible evil  something i never get tired of dream tactics follows the story of neru  a human who was summoned to the world of dreams  and her two guardians  luna and sophie  inhabitants of that dimension  their duty is to help neru unleash her potential  with the goal of reaching the dream eater  the villain  and giving him a good whacking  the plot itself is very classic  but as the narrative is very humorous it makes the adventure very jovial  in particular  the interactions between the characters stand out  and i found it all very cute and while we re at it  i should mention that the visuals are also very cute  the very small and minimalistic sprites brought back memories of some of my favorite gba games  most notably fire emblem  and the environments in each area are quite distinguishable and give off a classic vibe  i especially appreciate the effort put into the cards and items  as there are a lot of them and it must have been quite a job to create such variety  as a final point  i add that the music is not bad at all  and that is that each zone has its own melodies  some that stuck with me more than others leaving aside the visual and narrative spectacle  dream tactics shines especially for its gameplay  on the one hand  we ll be able to explore a total of five worlds  from the initial one with its greenish meadows  to dank deep crystal caverns  and the best thing is that we are given freedom of choice  that is to say  we can explore the worlds in the order we want  along the way we ll encounter barrels that we can break to get buttons  the game s currency  chests  which contain both equipment and cards for different characters  and npc  which will usually lead us to the turn based combat mode  although first i want to touch on the subject of decks and items to begin with  each unit can equip up to fifteen cards in their deck  and the number of copies of each one in particular depends on its rarity  from one to four at max  but in addition to the specific cards of each character  we can also equip those of our companions and vice versa  giving free rein to our ingenuity and creativity  we ll have a limit on friend s cards that we can use  of course  but even so it is quite generous and increases as we level up on the equipment side  we ll have a wide variety of objects with different attributes  from the most basic ones such as increasing defense or attack  to weapons that grant us special passives  or even change the stat scaling of a particular card  these gadgets also have their limit  represented by ep  equipment points   and here it is necessary to think about what to choose  because although the maximum ep increases along with our level  it is quite small at the beginning  after arming ourselves  we can focus on the battling  battles are quite intuitive  since we have our turn to move our units and attack  and then the enemies  turn  each turn we ll draw cards with their respective mana cost  and a maximum of these points to use  also counting with a limit of extra draws  again  very intuitive  but as i hinted earlier  the depth of combat in dream tactics is due to the amount of objects and cards with which we can customize the units  as  you can create very powerful and fun combinations if given the right conditions from power ups  altered state mixes  and bonuses unique to each unit  the combat is extremely entertaining and challenges our intellect  rewarding deck building shenanigans  on higher difficulties it s even more challenging  and this is coming from someone who wanted to start on hard and at a certain point had to put it on normal  in addition to the aforementioned  we ll have up to seven playable characters  four being unlockable for each world after the initial one  and each with their own skills and cards  further deepening the customizable aspect  truth be told  it was all very entertaining all in all  dream tactics is a game that blends two genres in a very fluid way  charming both for its visuals and its jovial narrative  and offering a deep and somewhat addictive customization  it far exceeded my expectations  which were already good  and left me but more than satisfied  especially with the boss fights and their particular mechanics  i should also add that i really liked that you can cancel the  end turn   in case you hit it unintentionally or the situation changes  and that one mp you had left over can finally shine  i would have liked to see an epilogue  but the overall experience it offers is very robust and satisfying  so i have no problem saying i highly recommend it",2024-04-20,2024-04-20,True,9,0,0.580353975296020508,0,False,True,False

enjoying the game  it could use some work  which is fair since it s still ea  growth and expansion is interesting  you don t just go around  slapping settlers in random tiles  you have to befriend native tribes and convince them to join you  i believe you can also war the tribes and seize the land  though i haven t done this yet  once this is done  you can then build a town in the region  regions in this game are similar to those in humankind  if you folks have played that  the combat is also similar to humankind  in which you form armies of troops and engage other armies  where the armies then spread out across the map and fight turn by turn  with reinforcements coming in over time  research is basic enough  it doesn t require too much interweaving  and you can  era up  pretty easily as well  other than the linear pathing for them  you can just imagine sid meier s tech trees  now  the  culture  aspect is    interesting  i don t know how it works if you re aggressive  but it you peacefully annex tribes  you can gain one of their cultural traits for your civilization  that s the gist of the culture  though they do provide plenty of boons  back in regards of the towns  now  it s nothing special  basically another sid meier s civ vi bit  where you have to build external districts  though they are limited by walls your town has  i don t yet know what causes these walls to expand out  armies  now    you start pretty basic  of course  some clubmen with basic armor  you can  however  modify troop equipment  you begin with 2 types of clubs and 3 or 4 shields  but only 1 armor type  at least  this was my first start  i don t know if this is universal   certain techs unlock new weapons  armors  and off hands  if you research the tech that gives bows  it unlocks the  marksman  class  as opposed to your basic footman class  there s also mobile infantry and artillery available  so mounted and catapults and the such  all units fall under these 4 classes  mix and match all you want  but you can only have 5 units in an  army  so far as i ve encountered  each material for weapons gives different bonuses  but you need  strategic resources  for most special kinds  for example  arrows  you can freely make wooden and stone arrows  wooden arrows give  1 range  but i want to say  1 damage  stone arrows  i believe  simply give  1 damage  there s other types  too  like iron  lead  electical  etc  these need the aforementioned strategic resources that you can eventually gain through exploring ruins  trading  or simply mining them from the ground  though they seem to be rare and you need techs to collect them now    the biggest unique piece to this game  terraforming  you can do this basically from game start  you need to research a different type of tech  you can research these and normal techs at the same time  to unlock more types of terraforming  but yeah  each tribe has a preferred climate type  and the one you choose at the start determines yours  you can terraform land to various climates  and you need to as well since your towns can only work their preferred climate  they also can heal on their climate  while diametrically opposed climates make troops lose hp  during battle only   i believe later on  you can even destroy or create mountains  and expand or shrink the oceans  but don t quote me on that part now  for the issues i have  some seem to be bugs  some may not  firstly  sometimes  if your troops don t have the movement to finish your path  the next turn the game will not notify you that they can move  you can end your turn  and they will only move the selected path  as a result  if you give a unit with 4 move a path of 6  they ll move 4  stop until next turn  then wait  you forget about them because the game doesn t tell you about them  you end turn  they move only the 2  and your turn completely ends  wasting those extra move points  there s no easy way to see movement points  you can sometimes hover over the unit on the map  sometimes you can t  when you can t  you have to select the army and hover over the individual units that form the army  not very quick to spot this information  but not a deal breaker  sometimes  ruins either don t get explored upon entering them  or they don t indicate beforehand that they have already been explored  some tell you they ve been visited already  but a few didn t  yet gave no reward  this could well be user issue  however addendum begins  one more thing i recently recalled  better game setup  the options at the beginning are rather limited  far as i could tell  we only had 2 characters we could choose from  we couldn t choose how many opponents we would face  the map options were limited  all things i d assume would get fixed as ea moves along  though i have not seen any indicator for an increase in army sizes  i had originally discovered it to be 5  but i just managed to create an army of 6  maybe it grows with each era my little robot does not like to automate its exploration very much  lost 2 turns of exploration with him trying to get it to automate  speaking of automation  town automation doesn t appear to work  if it does  i haven t noticed the changes  speaking of  you have to chop down forests to build agricultural regions  i have discovered  which explains the earlier issue of agricultural districts not showing recommendations  i find it annoying that every other district can be built with forests on the tiles  but agriculture cannot further automation desires  maybe one for the workers  themselves  this way i don t have to hunt down strategic resources or empty ruins i can tear down there is a 200 reputation cap  the game doesn t tell you this  but it exists and it just barely prevents you from enacting all the edicts at once  just an fyi for y all  another fyi  when you re terraforming  you can click the tiles that are selected to unselect them  and you can click on unselected tiles to select them  this  of course  is determined on the range  still  it can be helpful in regards to when you have low energy and need to terraform certain tiles  but the game wants you to get others with the automation  or if you re trying to demolish mountains but not erase additional coastlines  learned that the hard way when i went to bring down a mountain and it wanted to bring the ocean 3 tiles closer haha beware of landing your armies on unexplored islands  i was fortunate enough to only land one scout on a 7 tile hexagonal island that only contained an altar  not sure what this altar does  but since there s no clan  i can t make a town  which meant i had to simply delete this scout  it d been terrible if i had landed a sizable force first  no a possible bug  but maybe not  in my diplomacy with others  i had noticed that  since i was the strongest player in the game  the ai had a relationship modifier that said something along the lines of  we don t like that you are the most powerful nation  except it gave  50 loyalty  now  i have a modifier that says  we don t like your total supremacy over the planet   since i have since empowered my military further  this one gives a  50 modifier to 2 of the remaining ai  and  75 to the third  why does this happen  no idea  what i do know is that is effectively means you can t remain friendly with even the peaceful nations i m sure i ran into other problems  but if so  they were small enough to slip my mind by the time i finish this review  as i play more  and the team updates the game more  i ll update this

the game     h1 introduction  h1 the mortuary assistant is one of the best horror games you can play if you are looking to get scared and experience a horrific experience that is never quite the same due to its random paranormal events  you play rebecca  an assistant at a mortuary who works under her boss  raymond  her job entails putting corpses into storage after treating them with specific processes  https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3048847944the game is proficient in distraction and surprise  as you must manage your work as an assistant and deal with the demonic entities  the more time you take to perform the duties  the more rebecca will lose her mind  making her susceptible to the demon s influence  it creates a pace of juggling your responsibilities while avoiding getting spooked  h1 control and map design  h1 the mortuary assistant starts slow as the game gives you a tutorial on how to play it  and there is a big respite to get used to the title s mechanics  as progress is made and time goes by  the game will ramp up the scares to the point that there is no respite between the attacks specters and ghosts perform on you  that is an excellent design  as a horror game that sets the stage and atmosphere before the scares make you tense and more vulnerable to becoming afraid https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3048847390the task also plays a massive role in that atmosphere of dread and horror  as while they do not change between corpses  the interactions you will experience while working on them are entirely different  focusing too much on the checklist leaves you open to attacks  while not performing it fast makes paranormal activity more likely  while the map is small  as it s only the mortuary  it works in favor of the game as it gives a sensation of being trapped in a secluded space and  more importantly  a dreadful realization that you are completely isolated from other humans  your only company is the demons that are out to get you  h1  strong points  h1 the game s strong point is that the player shapes the experience  so it has no specific linear path  how the player plays and what the game presents in a single run creates a variable that makes it so that there is no way to prepare for what will happen or when  coupled with the atmosphere and tension  the game slowly introduces  and you have a formula for a title that  while short for a single run  can be pretty intense  h1  art design and visuals   h1 the mortuary assistant visuals are excellent  the game features high visuals that make the graphics look crisp and realistic  reinforcing the immersion when you play through it that you are in the mortuary  the corpses all have good detail  making looking at them a sight that can make you nervous as you wonder if they will move out of nowhere  the demons themselves come in various shapes resulting from figures that give comfort only to them crushed into despair  uneasy forms that can provide terrible frights and even shadows that chase after you when you least expect it  not having a single design for the demon and using multiple forms makes the game feel jumpy  for you do not know what shape they will take the next time they go after you  h1 sound  replayability and performance  h1 when it comes to sound  the game does a solid job  noise  phone calls  sound effects  and voice acting all add to the game s suspense  the demon can communicate with you  and choosing to let them speak can result in discomfort as you don t know how to answer the opportunity of speaking with another human as you let the phone ring  the voice actors do an excellent job of portraying characters and making the story believable https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3048848550replayability is something that the mortuary assistant keeps in mind  as five different endings can be unlocked  and the game always presents each run with some differences  holding the title fresh even after beating it  if you are a player that beats a game and then moves to another videogame  know that a run of the game takes around 2 4 hours  while getting all endings can result

mentioned technical problems first  let me say i got this on sale for  10 and it s definitely worth the price   now that it works  the day of purchase  there was a nasty bug that stopped the game from loading at all  based on the message board  i d say this was affecting most players  if not all  i nearly refunded the game  but i m glad i kept it now that the problem was addressed bugs problems   i haven t had any issues with crashing  but i do get some nasty lag spikes from time to time    i ve had tutorial quests bug out and stop registering completed tasks  i was able to correct this by reloading the game both times   with credit for the tasks i ve completed    i think the calculation of cash flow is buggy  i had a quest to earn  8k positive cash flow  i was hovering at   2500 for a long time  even with tenants coming and going and lease terms changing  didn t make sense  then one day it randomly said i completed the quest  even though i have no idea how i suddenly had an additional  5500 in cash flow  either it s buggy  or the way it s calculated or displayed is not intuitive   devs   please put in a way to mute or change the doorbell sound  it sounds exactly like my real doorbell  and it s louder than the rest of the sfx  so it s really annoying  the first time it went off  i didn t know that the service action cued it and actually went to my door  it makes my pets freak out every time it sounds  just let me get rid of it because it adds nothing to the game anyway  edit  one warning  after leaving this review  i purchased the pets dlc and the buggy tutorial broke my game  i had to start an entirely new game with the dlc disabled  just wanted to stick this caveat in here in case you re thinking of getting both  gameplay it definitely reminds me of the sims in the sense that you decorate homes in hopes of satisfying various needs  you can purchase various apartments homes unique lots and decorate them as you see fit   with the goal of attracting and keeping tenants to generate cash flow  within your owned properties there is some basic wall building removal allowed  there are also other jobs  but i don t play them unless the tutorial forces me to  you can  babysit  other tenants  which just means dealing with their problems for a set amount of time  you can also work the lease negotiation for other property owners  since i hate the lease negotiation part  i choose to avoid these the major difference from a mere decorating game is the phone that never stops going off  you have to handle tenant complaints  manage leases  and help your tenants with things like dates and workouts   realistic landlord sim it is not   tenants  it s hard for me to care about them because they re so hard to manage  they re unpredictably moody  i was thrilled when i was able to hire an agent to pass off some of the work  i ve started just bombarding them with services and gifts to keep them happy  i don t get lease negotiation at all  i have really happy tenants  yet they always try to lowball me  most of the time  they won t agree to pay enough to even cover expenses so i have to let them go  this is even when they re satisfied and i spent thousands of dollars doing renovations based on their requests  i don t know how they can be paying  1500 a month  be really happy  and expect to sign a new lease at  200 a month  this is insane  then there s the timing of the lease re negotiations  i ve lost good tenants because i don t get a final warning to negotiate the lease before they go  i see one warning  then they just text me and say  see ya   i get that the time management and stress is part of the game  but it sucks when i lost a client forever  after spending tons of money and research on them  because i was busy when i got my one warning  would it be so bad to get a text message saying  i m about to pack my crap and leave   do you want to talk about this lease  last chance  for the most part  the tenants are annoyances that get in the way of building cool apartments jobs as i said  i only do the renovation jobs  they can be pretty entertaining  the early jobs make it seem trivial  but they get much harder  sometimes you have to fit a ton of furniture and decoration into a small space  or you have to hit a target prestige level on a low budget  i ve had a few where it took 20 minutes of fiddling to get the project how i wanted it unique jobs are cool  it was a nice surprise that i would also be asked to renovate gas stations  yoga studios  restaurants  and a military barracks  to name a few   you do get repeats  but you don t have to take them furniture variety there s quite a bit to choose from  for the price  i wasn t expecting as many options as i was given  and i m still earning more on a regular basis  you can get really creative with your projects  which is the whole reason i got the game  i spend a lot of time on my owned properties  where i m entirely in charge  with remodel jobs  you can focus on nailing a good score without worrying too much about the looks   sometimes it s just about cramming stuff into a room  you can make a very personalized  unique home with what you re given  especially as new decorations and items unlock  if the devs release new furniture style packs  i would most likely buy them if the price is right verdict if you like decorating and arranging furniture  it s a go  i m a fan of everything from the sims to big ambitions to tavern keeper winkleje crossroads inn  and this game reminds me of all of them in some way  just imagine playing the former and having the sims on autopilot while you focus on being a property manager and you ve pretty much got the idea  as far as i can tell  the most terrible bugs have been fixed  save games  crashes  failure to launch  etc   get it without hesitation on sale  if it gets to the point of bug free  it will be worth every penny of full price the devs could do a lot with this premise  and i hope they do  besides adding new furniture decor  it would be awesome if they added some kind of business aspect to it  they already have gas stations  laundromats  and restaurants as renovation projects  so it d be cool to open up my own to generate revenue rather than turning my properties over to crappy  ungrateful tenants   p",2023-09-05,2023-09-07,True,27,0,0.780230283737182617,0,True,False,False

and nothing to play in that time  miss going to the arcade  enjoy both arena shooters and pixel graphics  wanna find yourself saying  it s hiiigh noon     while the bodies of your enemies collapse unto the dust  still have that ol   i dark country  i  blues saraceno playlist from like a decade ago  want to play a grim western that doesn t have  west  in the title  not care about story as long as the gameplay is solid  sometimes enjoy minimalist design over a plethora of unnecessary features    then welcome to my after 100   b entirely subjective  b  recommendation of  strike  i duck hunt  i   strike   b  i kill the crows  i   b i wandered unto  i kill the crows  i   store page back in september  i liked the screenshots  the trailer was atmospheric and cool  and the price felt more than fair  a few days later  i got to see splatt play it  and i bought it  starting out  i was bad  i repeatedly shot at the crates and walls  i dodged into attacks while trying to evade others more times than i care to admit  and when it comes to the number of times i heard my gun go  click   instead of  bang   all i can say is    yikes  the skill issue was a special type of infuriating  got a bit better after a couple hours as i found my mojo  the enemies felt challenging but not unfair  tried out every unlock as soon as i got it  didn t mind dying as much  i knew i could get farther in the next run  and that s when i realized     i kill the crows  i  is fun  yes  i m bad and yes  it s difficult  but it is nevertheless fun  the rounds are insanely quick with almost no downtime  there s a feeling of accomplishment that comes with getting better at a skill based game like this one  you can run and  finish  the whole game with the starter pistol and no other unlocks if you re skilled enough i got 100  completion in a weekend and ended on a high note  i hadn t bumped into any bugs  everything felt polished  functional  fun  and i thought that s where  i kill the crows  i  and i would part ways    but then in november 5minlab released a patch  balance fixes  more unlockables  more enemies  neat  and then another patch in december  new bosses and an arcade y story mode to bring a level of finality to the game both of these patches  came at no extra cost  maybe i ve been exposed to too much corporate greed  microtransactions  inane and unnecessary dlcs  and just overall toxic and predatory cash grabbing but i was both so pleasantly shocked and simply impressed   i kill the crows  i  was a hidden gem from release  and thanks to the devs  hard work  it had just gotten a lot better    with no added cost  something i like to call  a  i no man s sky  i  event  sooo yeah    replaying  getting to the new 100   and writing this recommendation were unavoidable  i kill the crows  i  is gritty tale  bout gettin  revenge and rootin  tootin  shootin  puttin  a whole lotta people into the ground  the crows are this cult of seriously twisted folks who decided that the best way to get the plot going was to murder town after town  as sacrifice and tribute to     i something  i   turns out  they got what they wanted all nice and wrapped up in a bow of careful what you wish for  izzy  she s referred to as both isabella and isabelle  so izzy it is  died with enough hatred in her heart to be chosen and brought back by the eye  the latter presenting itself as a manifestation of the aforementioned something all the story there is can be found in boss dialogues and unlock descriptions  there isn t a lot depth or text  but i savored every word visually  and functionally  i kill the crows  i  is both simplistic and exceptional  the arena looks good and feels tactical  there s enough enemy variety and density to keep things spicy for the  20 minutes an average round takes  the models are easily discernible in the arena without feeling out of place every sound is clear  crisp  and well chosen  i can listen to someone else playing with my eyes closed and can easily tell what s happening at every point  the single repeating music track is the only negative  see remark about  i dark country  i  playlist the achievements only ask for progress  skill  and minimum grind the steam badges are clean and sharp  with well chosen names  i like the desperado a lot  gunslinger is great as well but i find it a bit too cluttered be warned  reading from this point on may lead to your own joy of discovery being spoiled https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 3064128585 h2 one shot  one kill  h2 this is the golden rule  you die from one hit  but so do your enemies   swapped keybinds between  dodge   to right click  and showdown  to space  and i had a good time with it   there s only one arena and it has good zones  there s no strategic advantage to staying in the center  so roam often  find reliable cover  as well as opportunities to funnel enemies   reload often  the crimson and the leather bandolier make no ammo reloading more efficient but apart from those there s no reason to not reload whenever you have the chance to do so  melee enemies don t always need to be taken out as soon as they re unobstructed   rather than just pushing higher kill counts  focus on getting unlocks  unlock conditions don t retroactively trigger so rushing to get to 600 kills won t unlock anything if it s not required   perfect dodges come with a sound cue and a brief time slow   don t bank more than one showdown charge  you won t ever need two consecutive showdowns to progress   aiming showdown comes with a brief time slow window  take advantage of this by quickly choosing your targets and then spending the rest of the timer looking for the next priority   showdown doesn t use your bullets  in addition to that  using showdown  except cursed gaze  also reloads your weapon   as long as there s a clear line of sight  one showdown bullet can take down any non boss enemy  i like to use showdown to quickly get rid of barriers  snipers  and magicians   you can t shoot through gravestones unless you have cursed gaze ghost bullets  to quickly deal with reaper  1st boss   after the dialogue  hit one of the green crows  wait for the boss to crow burst move respawn  bait an attack  rush after the attack is done  hit the 2nd green crow  dodge tumble around the gravestone wall  and kill reaper while still downed   shaman s  2nd boss  large area of invulnerability means that they only have a limited number of places where they can spawn  don t reload during lightning bolt attacks as the slowdown will kill you  dodging can save your life from a lightning bolt  but it won t help get distance from them as the spawn is always centered on where you are   you thought this was a cute arcade western but after 300 kills  you ll learn it s a survival horror  getting the heebee jeebies just thinking about it   killitwithfire  hunter  3rd boss  is scary    and pretty cool  don t dodge too early  the dash attack has a bit of a delay on the claw swipe  get as many walls and obstacles as you can between you and them while you re hunting down the blood shields   if you want to see all the dialogues get ready to kill 900 crows  my favorite loadout  pocket cannon  cursed gaze  leather bandolier  old harmonicain closing   i kill the crows  i  is a short and sweet callback to an older era of gaming  its minimalism and character are ultimately charming and its replayability value lies in fast rounds and skill based progression  i hope it does well and i happily recommend it  h3 play it  final rating  4 5 crow skulls and a silver bullet or whatever     h3        well  friend  you ve made it to words  end and for that you have my sincere gratitude  until next

viewing things  i am going for it basically  the reason why this game has such a small deck size  and does not allow you to save deck drafts  is because it wants you to experiment and  even if you want to rebuild a deck as it was before  you will probably decide to make some changes in the middle way  and that is the best part of it the peak arrived when i was competing in the midas coup and i probably changed the deck build more than 20 times  switching between combinations of all 5 different characters  there is when i understood why this game was such a unique way of approaching a turn based card game  i already started loving it while playing the main story  but  at the beginning  i felt uncomfortable with having to change the deck structures and having only 8 cards to choose each  but i think that that was a consequence of all my years playing hearthstone  i just had to be re educated  and i loved going through that  also  answering the criticism on it  gotta say that i support the  not the best story  complaints  but  still  i didn t mind at all  the characters looked unique and beautiful  and i was interested in completing the game 100   fighting  which i never got tired of  which talks positively about the testing job done   leveling up  and seeing what was next  their overall personalities got inside my head while playing  and that was all i needed  i was not in need of dialogues that made me think  or a final plot twist that i could not think of  i just wanted to go on  find new enemies  fight them  fight the next boss  and enjoy a loop that  after the first world  hooked me in completely until completing the game entirely the other complaint i saw was about the inconvenient moments of given cards  and  i am going to say something  you  or someone else  would have complained from the opposite  being given a card like  hey  pssst  play this now   also  this goes with one of the best parts of the game  it does sum up to the later stages where you will be in need of changing the deck   because  i cannot understand what kind of a player that is not dead inside  would want the game to reward him to be able to play the entire game with the same deck  and you will have to reconsider options that before made no sense  or  for example  armilly  that soon gets completely kicked from the main team due to the two new characters arrival  and then  it is given two cards that suddenly make her worth trying  and she ended up being in the final setup that i had to think thorough to beat the midas grand prix  where she had an incredibly more important role as a support and damage dealer  even getting separated from those two cards  that sometimes where even rerolled  my only personal complaint is that even playing in legend  the maximum difficulty offered   i never lost a single combat more than once  and it happened only twice during the entire game   barely losing items  except from some tournaments  which gave me the moment of going all out  which i loved i strongly think  that legend should have been new game   because yes  now i have the new game plus waiting for me  whenever i return to the game with the will to play it  but that will not be now  because i just played like 40 hours  because in this 57 there are some of iddle since it is a turn based game without timer   and now i do not want to repeat the game  entirely  even being short as it is  because it was exhausting in a way  above anything else  in this midas grand prix thing now at the end  and it drained my energy of repeating the game  which  by the way  give a way to check how many turns are left any time  please xd   also  the coins for upgrading cards in the shop could cost 50 and it would still be really expensive to pay for upgrades  i had to farm 34k for one hour on the shroom to be able to play the midas coup with the three decks leveled up  and because i was lucky enough to not enter the behemoth level until completing it  because then i might have had to farm 30k more to get those last items xdd  whatever  as i was saying  since one 100  playthrough was enough to drain my energy for now  i would have loved to play the entire game with every enemy as a challenge  as the new game  will probably be  but the thing is that that is what i expected to receive from selecting the legend difficulty still  very unique game  and excellently well executed  and plus congrats to the ones behind the concept art of the characters  i really enjoyed playing this  as i loved sw heist  and as i will probably enjoy the  dig s  when i decide to play them  good

following its development for some time now  and the negative reviews have always put me off purchasing it  especially considering the not so light price tag  couple that with the fact i m a mac user  and it felt very likely i would be disappointed  even if i got it to work  fortunately  i was wrong i downloaded the demo and got it running without any issues on crossover  v23 5 0  i m on a macbook pro running sonoma   it serves as a fantastic introduction to the game s mechanics  universe  and lore and a prequel to the main storyline in which you control a character that will assume a supporting role in game  i was sold and bought the game as soon as i finished it  i m writing this testimony because i feel this game s lukewarm  or outright terrible  in some reviews  reception on steam is a bit unfair  and i think the devs  it seems to be a tiny team  deserve some recognition for what looks like a real labour of love   i ve always been a big rpg and strategy fan  but nowadays  with work and real life commitments  i ve become somewhat of a casual gamer  i do enjoy complex games  but my playing sessions are usually limited to 1 2 hours  i m sharing this information to say that i m not an enthusiast of impossibly difficult games  ultra complex mechanics or anything of the sort  and i don t think stoneshard is any of that  it is challenging  even frustrating sometimes  but it gives you so much freedom that there s almost always a viable strategy to get what you want  it reminds me a bit of elder scrolls iv  oblivion in that you can grind and power through with brute force  sure  but you can also steal  ambush and trick your way to the top  you might die a lot  but each run shows you the weak spots in your strategy so you can refine your course of action until you achieve goals that seemed impossible before   h1 setting   h1 the story unfolds in a medieval renaissance  low fantasy universe  think game of thrones  that allows for a charming degree of realism  presenting historically inspired locations  equipment and lore  the world feels alive  culturally distinct settlements  harsh expanses of wilderness and mysterious locations filled with  often supernatural  danger and loot  the nomadic mercenary lifestyle is well represented as you have to manage your supplies  lodging and budget   this aspect seems to be on the brink of a major update with the caravan system   h1 gameplay  h1  stoneshard plays like a cross between a light roguelike  a crpg and a hack and slash  diablo ii comes to mind   action is universally turn based  which means you can  and should  take your time to think before each step  experience and levelling up are acquired through battle and exploration  and you can unlock the tiers of the many skill trees by reading books that can be acquired as loot or bought  there are no fixed character classes  but you can pick from a roster of characters with different backgrounds that  in turn  grant each one an unique ability  the option to create a character from scratch is in the development pipeline  and the skill trees you chose to invest your points in define your character aptitudes and can cater to your playing style besides that  the game has enough survival elements to make it compelling  but they are part of a streamlined system that s easy to understand and manage  this characteristic applies to virtually all aspects of gameplay  the mechanics have quite a lot of depth  but are intuitive enough for you to figure out on your own  and they don t force you to play with a calculator in hand or consult the wiki every 10 minutes  for some reason  it might also be due to the graphics   it reminds me of lucasart s desktop adventures series in its intuitive presentation and in that each quest feels like a standalone adventure  which also nicely bookends gameplay sessions   the quest system seems to be a work in progress  as well as factions  crafting  alchemy and many other planned features  other players have noted development has been slow  but the devlog is up to date and features constant sneak peeks of what s to come  besides that  the game is perfectly playable and engaging in its current state  i haven t come across any game breaking bugs   h1 graphics   h1 stoneshard s graphics were probably what got me interested in the game in the first place  gorgeous high resolution pixel art  smooth animations  visible equipment changes  and consistent ui  it looks impressive  and i dare say there s nothing like it in 2024  its consistent art direction and execution are on par with the most visually elaborate late 90s pc  amiga or neo geo games  the graphics showcase the commitment and effort put in by the art team  as nothing feels out of place  and everything is polished to the smallest detail  character  scenario and equipment designs are outstanding  everything feels grounded and consistent with the game s low fantasy setting   h1  pricing and development   h1 although the free demo is a nice gesture  and i bought the game on sale  i felt the price was a bit high  i m based in south america  so games without regional pricing weigh a lot in our pockets  for comparison  stoneshard s price tag in my country is close to steam top sellers like gta v  farcry 4 or monster hunter  world  i think it will be more than fair for the finished product  but ea games always run the risk of being abandoned  i was an avid player of towns  another ambitious project with a somewhat hefty price tag for ea  and it failed spectacularly  triggering the community s ire  that said  it fortunately doesn t seem to be the case here  though i ve seen a lot of complaints about the updates being few and far between  the devs are active on twitter  and the updates so far seem to have been substantial  often bringing in not only content like new items and enemies but whole new mechanics  this includes the next one in the pipeline   h1 bottomline   h1 stoneshard might not be everyone s cup of tea  but if you are an old school rpg fan  medieval fantasy buff  and enjoy a fair challenge  i can t recommend it enough  you re guaranteed to spend many hours playing it  it s engaging  gorgeous and exceptionally polished for an ea game  when and if the development roadmap is fully realised  it might become one of my favourite games ever  i can attest it s not impossibly hard or grindy  and it s in active development  albeit slow  as of 2024",2024-01-09,2024-01-16,True,41,0,0.789392948150634766,1,True,False,True

into this solo endeavor is deserving of all the respect in the world  so i thought i d try writing up a quick review  however  i don t think there s much praise i can give that hasn t already been given in other reviews  so i decided i d try giving an alternate perspective on some more negative reviews here  from the view of someone who has spent way too much time playing this game 1   gacha system has no pity system    it s not a traditional pity system  but outright saying there s no pity system is a bit misleading  holoparade gives you a guaranteed ur every 10 gacha rolls on a specific banner  and you receive tickets to freely choose any particular srs or urs from a specific banner after 15 and 30 rolls respectively 2   ai is frustrating until you learn how to counter auras    so learn how to counter auras  that s what the combat is built around  that s like saying  the enemies in mario are frustrating until you learn how to jump   and in terms of the enemy side just being more powerful than your team physically can be  i can kind of see where this argument comes from  but at the same time  if the enemy teams always follow the same rules and standards as you have to  then the game would be way too easy  there obviously needs to be imbalance so that you have something to overcome 3   there s no point in using the non mascot members as they cost too much    ignoring the fact that this was addressed in the update just today  even prior to the update i would disagree  as later levels completely revolve around using a strong ur capable of tanking hits and pushing out a lot of damage  and the older voltage system  that has since been changed  made room for very interesting ways to increase the rate of your currency  forcing you to decide between a more balanced yet more expensive and slower building team  or a team built around 7 cheap and weak mascots only used to build up symphony and garner funds for a lone over powered member 4   it s an idle game    towards the beginning  i d honestly agree  but when you reach some of the later levels  the timing of when you send out certain units can actually greatly affect your performance  so surprisingly  the parades actually take a good amount of focus as you progress  and personally  i got a bit too into some of those late game matchups    whether my obake chan would hold out had me at the edge of my dang seat 5   it s a grind fest    i can see a lot of people agreeing with this viewpoint  and i honestly think that s valid  but i do believe it more comes down to how much you enjoy the core strategizing  a lot of games with strong strategy rpg elements balance their combat with story or exploration in between  whereas holoparade is almost exclusively strategy and combat with very little else to do  there was a cute endless runner minigame at launch  with promises of three more minigames to be added at later dates  one of which having just been added in a more recent update   but i feel as though holoparade s equivalent to a  break between combat  really just comes down to the hololive content  gacha  members showing up in the menu  hearing from nodoka  reading comments in the marketing menu  etc  hence why the common argument of  no reason to play if you re not a hololive fan  may actually hold a bit of weight  but personally  i really enjoy the gameplay loop at its core    that being said  these are just examples of very odd complaints i read that i wanted to respond to  but i do want to bring up a con that i feel is a bit more grounded and may affect some players  experiences  that being the idea that once you find a single team lineup that steamrolls nearly every level  you re basically autopiloting through the game now  this is an argument i can totally understand someone getting upset with  as i kind of did feel it happening to me towards the middle of my playtime  and i definitely feel it important to bring up    however  my mindset eventually shifted  as 1  though the beginning of the game can kind of be stomped through by just using a more broken team  the late game aura filled teams really do eventually force your hand  to the point where even if you have some members with buffs against specific auras on your side  it may still not be enough if not min max d or balanced well enough  additionally  2  the team building and trial and error ing to find that  best steam roller team  to begin with was where i garnered the majority of my fun in the mid game  learning the game s mechanics on a deeper level and labbing out what elements were more worth my focus and what elements could be sacrificed in favor of maxing other stats was so much fun  and i feel that what you do out of parades is just as important to the gameplay experience as the parade outcomes themselves and lastly  3  this newest update completely flipped team building strategies  and even core fundamental game mechanics  on their heads  there are now a ton more variables to mess with  and though i haven t tinkered too much  i can already see so much more potential  and with all this new stuff to learn  i m incredibly excited to get back to the grind    i think that s about all the bases i wanted to cover  in summary  there are definitely flaws worth pointing out  and things that not everyone will enjoy from this game  but i just wanted to point out how i felt some arguments being made in other reviews felt very unwarranted and haphazard  and also just say that personally  this game is my

page for plenty more   b   url   quote reveil is a first person psychological horror game that mostly takes place inside the mind of protagonist walter  he suddenly awakes after having a nightmare only to find that both his wife martha and his daughter have disappeared  unable to remember what happened  he needs to discover the mystery behind his family s disappearance  soon enough  walter starts questioning his reality and the environments take the shape of his imagination  bringing him into a dark circus filled with unsettling attractions and hostile monstrosities  as you can imagine  this is the classic formula for horror narrative driven waking sims  for the record  i enjoyed  i layers of fear  i    although i don t include it amongst the best horror gaming experiences i ve had   but i have grown tired of horror games that use the same narrative clich s  amnesia  surrealism  hallucinations  trivial psychology   it was cool when  i silent hill  i  was the only one doing it  but now it s getting way too abused in my opinion  that said  if you loved lof you will likely enjoy this one too  but probably less so the game is divided into five acts and really doesn t take long to complete  it took me about 5 hours  including reading notes and looking in every corner for collectibles  there are quite a lot    but someone who just wants to follow the story might complete it in four hours or less  i can t talk about the story too much because this is the entire game  but what i can say for sure is that the protagonist talks too much and doesn t allow you to interpret the story in your own way or to just feel the environment  the voice acting isn t good either  it felt like the actor knew the lines but not the context of where the action happens  either that or he didn t care too much   the house sections were great and immediately reminded me of  i pt  i  and  i visage  i   the other  mostly surreal  environments were more linear and less interesting  there are twists here and there throughout the story  but none that really shocked me  the multiple endings depend only on a choice that you can make at the end  so there isn t any replayability  the one i got was short and felt like a rushed epilogue  and the others that i saw online were no more satisfying than mine  i don t understand the idea of making multiple short endings rather than one solid ending  especially considering that the game is extremely linear   why give a choice at the end when there were none throughout the entire game being a story driven game  all you have to do is explore each new location you are thrown into and solve puzzles while trying not to be seen by hostile monstrosities  some puzzles are a bit more creative  but most of them require that you find a key item and bring it to another place in order to progress  that s not really difficult even when playing hide and seek with the monster   in between the story you do get some cheap jumpscares and parts where you are being chased by a monster  again  typical scenarios for a horror game that no longer provide any tension or surprise to someone who eats horror games for breakfast now the graphics are really beautiful at max settings  each location is created in great detail and provides some very good atmospheric moments  also thanks to the great lighting in both external and internal locations  the game performance is also good  only few frame drops here and there  but this is not the kind of game where you need 60 fps or more all the time   table      tr          th    pros   th          th   cons   th       tr      tr          td   beautiful graphics  the house sections are better than the rest  td          td   too many gameplay and narrative horror stereotypes  most puzzles are very basic  very short game  voice acting isn t good  td   tr   table  h1 verdict  6 10  h1 i think that reveil is a game that maybe takes too much from other games from the same genre  particularly  i layers of fear  i   while not adding anything new or different to the gameplay and narrative structure  not only is the game short  especially considering the price  and without any replay value  but it lacks tension and except for a few atmospheric moments  doesn t engage you in the protagonist s story  it might be worth trying if only for the beautiful graphics and locations  especially if you like the circus   but it certainly won t be a memorable horror experience  quote  i key provided by the developer publisher for review purposes  any opinions expressed are entirely my own   i   quote  quote

142667362,76561198308118939,0,47,465,0,465,2023-07-24,english,"card shark is a game set in historical france  following the story various con artists who are out to run scams and unveil a conspiracy that is happening in the upper ranks of the kingdom  for this  the game teaches you quite a lot of scams you need to employ and execute correctly and includes some quite dangerous and risky games  and other scenarios  in which you need to win money and get the information you want before your opponents get suspicious visually  i am completely impressed with this game  i honestly didn t expect that much when buying the game  but i found the art style and level of polish quite impressive  the game has tons of unique animations and feels very lively and well designed and it s really good at creating unique atmospheres for about every place you visit and the soundtrack was amazing too the narrative starts rather simple  but as you progress through the story quite a lot of unexpected things start to happen and the story went from being engaging enough to keep playing to me finishing the whole game in a day because i wanted to know how the story would shake out the narrative told is also a really immersive expierience  where getting the information you want feels very earned and the story knows how to build tension  i also really loved the idea of a mute protagonist  because it felt like the writers genuinely explored how a character like that would exist in the world and it wasn t just a cheap gimmick to explain why the game protagonist didn t have speaking lines as a smaller criticism i felt the game sometimes communicated some controls in a rather unintuitive way  which never really was too frustrating  but it took me quite some tries to get a few things right  like e g  i only understood how sword fighting was supposed to work after 4  attempts  and i like that the game offers you a tutorial for these moments so you arent killed 4  times in the story  as death isnt just a  try again  state   but this creates another problem  which is  that you expierience a constant feeling of  still being in the tutorial   this isnt as bad as it sounds  but after a while i grew a bit exhausted of learning more and more techniques  there are 28 techniques to cheat at the game  which you get introduced to through the entire story   and i genuinely would have sometimes wished for the game to only have  15 techniques  with more of a focus on  getting better  at the techniques and improving your interaction time with them  since some of them felt a bit one off and gimmicky  or even if they didn t  while i liked almost all of them  i just found them to be a bit too many  you literally get the achievement  complete all tutorials  when there are only two games left in the story  but what i really liked is that  even though the game throws a lot of tutorials at you  it never just hands you the answers while actually playing or is otherwise patronizingly giving you hints   you need to be smart and fast and adapt cryptic hints and shuffle cards to fit the order of these cryptic hints and that honestly felt really good  because while i wished there would have been an additional chapter or so after you are finally done with the tutorials  you weren t really in the tutorial anymore and the game would at times get really mean  i mean that affectionately i especially loved the techinques that forced you to think on your own part about a strategy to improve them and execute them as fast as possible and i think the combination of all available techniques made the games feel like pulling a con really was a bit of luck  a bit of logic  a bit of forsight  a bit of strategy and a bit of dexterity  and you always also had to look out for your opponent and i thought that the game really was just right when it came to difficulty for me  i still felt like some techniques that were more qte based really didn t feel very accessible or incredibly fun to me   i am not in any way physically disabled  but i still struggled with the hand eye coordination   exactness the game wanted of me  so i feel like a person who might actually have some impediments when it comes to controlling games will find some sections quite frustrating but generally i found the game and the mechanics  especially in combination with the story  really enjoyable and i felt like i was in that one type of anime where every conflict is solved by winning at card games and everyone in the universe just adheres to this rule without question  the jobs were never too easy to pull or too hard and i was super hooked on finishing the game  and i wholeheartedly loved the last 2 games where the stakes are super high and you need to pull of the biggest con you did until that point  and that is to say that while i think this game has some minor flaws  i want to empathize how much i loved playing a game that aimed  and very often succeeded  to be so full of innovative mechanics  i really wish there were more games that would do stuff like this instead of adhering to more well known formulas tl  dr  card shark is quite an unconventional game in a lot of ways  and i really enjoyed it  all of that innovation in mechanics comes with some rough edges at some points in gameplay  especially a lot of tutorials   but i still generally think that the game tried to handle these problems as gracefully as they could  if you think that sort of game is for you i can really recommend

space combat  crew management  explorationif constructing a fleet of ships surrounded by fightersif you enjoy good times and are patient  you will find much joy here  for me  every run i imagine the a captain  i imagine their thoughts and desires  how would they react and respond to the the universe they were given i will tell you of my stories so far  the first run i ran out of fuel and was confused  i slowly watched as the power went out and my people faded away the second i ran out of the resource to warp  i was stuck floating in a zone praying someone would come someone didpirates the third run i rage quit because all of my people got space herpes and exploded now  this was the run  i felt it  i always go in with the crew i am given minus 1 exception  1 person must have 4 botany  other than that i keep everything  i had a great botanist but i also had a lazy person   and a charmer  the fourth was bland but helpful no one had mining above 1 and only a single crew member could raise it to 2  things were slow  i grew at a tedious pace  desperately balancing my research and resources to ensure i could expand while also maintaining power  energium is the most important thing the run was going alright  day 79  my personal best so far i was stationed next to a civilian mining platform  currently i was experimenting with mining for my own energium so that i could spend more money elsewhere  i purchased more than 4000 credits worth of ore  i was feeling confident then   a mighty asteroid crashed into my ship  it caused a large fire and killed my entire crop of food  i had only 5 days remaining  then   several hours later  micros   dozens of tiny untargetable meteorites crashing and exploding everywhere  i could not afford anymore infrablocks and the civilians kept asking me to donate them some the storm ended  1 crew member was covered in first degree burns and the other was unconscious from the smoke  i had to carry them out while the fourth maintained the point defense  it was time i left this system  i decided to buy some scraps of food from the civilians and leave however there was a problem i was unable to hail them  i looked at the station dark  no lights quickly i suited up two crew members and boarded the station had a large entrance  several holes in the room  no oxygen 239 fi knew as we searched each room that no one could have survived  the station was dead though i felt guilty i decided it would be disrespectful to waste their lives  it took 9 days to fully clear and transfer the station  13 days of power  25 days of food  i had never seen the numbers in green  they had always been red i upgraded the ship  expanded the sides and the garden  installed 2 energy turrets and a shield generator after exploring the system i found several large deposits of ore so i quickly began to gather them nearby an abandoned ship was overrun with rogue robots  they only had a few small defenders that we removed quickly  inside we found a man  a man with 6 shooting as we finished scrapping the ship someone jumped into our sector   had i been warned  i did not remember   perhaps i was not paying attention pirates   we called for battle stations  as we returned to our ship we were already under fire  i gave the new crew mate a rifle  i had it for ages but nobody could wield it  and mounted the consoles  the energy turrets blasted through their laser turrets but we took heavy damage  i targeted their engines and focused on repairs  several fires broke out and smoke had filled the console room preventing us from engaging shields or manning the weapons  i built a gas scrubber and waited until it was clear  the cabin was clear and the crew returned to their stations  we destroyed their shuttle hanger to prevent boarding and i allowed my crew to sleep they woke  ate  shit then suited up for the first time i was boarding a hostile ship  for the first time i had a battle that did not end with the bodies of my crew dripping on the floor no oxygenlivable temperaturewe kept the suits on and explored the ship  the console had two bodies and there was one dead in the kitchen  we searched the cargo area and found two more dead  in the very back was a room  a small room   we opened the door and to my shock we found something two bodies and one person in a suit unconscious on the floor they were the only person from the 7 total bodies we found in a suit  i knew they had no chance of survival but i picked them up and walked towards our shuttle  we returned home and somehow they survived  i do not know what their health was but when they placed in my medical bed they had 8 health the battles and stories have only gotten more epic and exciting for me  i love this game and i truly believe if you give yourself some time

super super super deep and not easy to completely understand until you have spent at least 40 hours  if you are not playing on the sandbox mode  you will spend a minimum of 40 hours just getting your ship fully set up with hospital beds  important consoles like the shield navigation console and all the other amenities like toilets and hyper sleep chambers and all that  i would have to write a book to fully explain everything you can do in this game  but since most people don t have that kind of time  i will try to sum it up in a couple sentences  turned out to be very emotional paragraphs sorry not sorry   this game lets you go to space and travel endlessly through an infinite  procedurally generated  universe  build a small but useful ship at first  collect recruit buy  from the slavers guild  crew members  farm crops on your ship  trade for resources with other factions  fight other factions and take them prisoner when they board your ship and then negotiate with them to release their crew for money and other resources or recruit those captive crew members and make them join your crew  you can perform surgical operations on your crew members with doctors on your ship or allied ships to make them work faster  become stronger  heal faster  learn a particular skill a bit more  and so much more  you will quickly learn that space is not like disneyland or starwars  it is harsh and brutal  you will grow close to your crew members who work hard  fight valiantly  fall in love with each other  and show up to work on time all day everyday  sometimes you must hold back tears as you watch them die from starvation  combat  aliens  and alien eggs spores  lack of oxygen  fires  and so so much more  after you pick them up with another crew member and move them to the nearest hospital bed and get your best most skilled doctor to operate on them  even worse  you have to watch their comrades suffer from depression and mood swings to cope with the loss of their friend lover because of the decision that you made which got them killed  space is so hard that sometimes you must make your crew eat their own dead comrades or enemies to prevent them from starving and you really question your life  your morals and values  and if it was worth it to run away from earth  space  is  hard  i liked the game very much before the update but after the new update  i ve just completely fallen in love with this game  in the new update there are many new changes  one of those changes lets you build fighter planes in space for your pilots to fly and attack other ships  two of my pilots were ordered to attack a pirate ship  after a couple successful hits  their planes were destroyed by the enemy s air defense and they were forced to enter the enemy s ship after their spacesuits ran out of oxygen  normally  after their planes are destroyed  they return back to your ship by using thrusters on their spacesuit but if your ship is too far away and they don t have enough oxygen  they will be forced to enter the enemy s ship  after boarding the pirate ship  one of my pilots fights valiantly until she is surrounded by enemies and is forced to surrender after losing more than half of her hp  the other pilot is a true chad and enters a part of their ship where he cannot be flanked and shoots 5 pirates and makes them surrender  soon after  my shuttle is automatically sent to the enemy ship and both my pilots board it and return to my ship  keep in mind that although all these actions can be manually controlled  they can also happen automatically  and it is so beautiful to watch if you are into real time strategy  ofc i had to give both of those pilots private rooms with arcade games  private toilets  and hull windows to fall asleep to breath taking views sometimes my pilots get captured and taken prisoner and then i have to plan a rescue op to go and get them back  although it is time consuming  it is so much fun to lower your shields  make the enemy attack you  and then use your ship s weapons and fighter planes to destroy their engines to make sure they cannot fast travel with your captive crew on their ship  i then have to send a squad of 4 in 1 shuttle to board their ship  search it  rescue my captive pilots crew and then call for another shuttle to come and take them because only 4 people are allowed on 1 shuttle  so many things can go wrong like  fires  lack of oxygen  in which case you need to deploy oxygen tanks which is kind of tricky at first   your squad getting captured or killed or hurt badly  aliens laying eggs and taking over the ship if you don t kill the eggs fast enough and so much more but i don t want to spoil it for you ultimately  the choice is yours  what kind of space commander will you be  are you going to be a pushover who lets military ships scan your ship for contraband prisoners slaves other illegal stuff  or are you going to be robin hood who steals from the rich merchant federation military alliance and gives to the poor starving pirates  are you going to go out of your way to risk life and death to board slave ships to free human beings and sentient robots being held captive for the satisfaction you get when you see them lose their chains and slave collars or maybe you re the kind of person who sells your crew or captives to the slavers guild for money  maybe you like watching sentient robots being torn apart by your crew for important and valuable parts that you can use or sell  maybe you re a heartless monster who only cares about money and nothing else what kind of space commander are you  what do you value in life  who are you at core of your soul after you watch your crew eat other human beings  i guess you ll find

sent down to the sunken depths of davey jone s locker  yarr  for ease of ye reading  i ve broken me thought down in te ayes and nays and me thoughts on each  h1 introduction  h1 the life and suffering of sir brante is a choose your own adventure game  when i first started the game i expected it to be more brutal  especially with the warning from the start  i found that while the game setting is quite brutal  the game itself is not  i ve completed one play through and tried experience as many endings as i could from my game s worth of choices  i ll be exploring my thoughts in me ayes and me nays  h1 ayes   h1  b presentation  b the game is presented as a story book with detailed illustrations  each tab represents a slice of sir brate s standing in the world  from a game map  to the standing of the house of sir brante  skills  family relationships and the sort  the game itself runs smoother then a clipper with a full sail of wind  it fits the setting well  b setting  b the world of sir brante is brutal and rigid  you are born into your lot and the world for the most part expects you to stay in your lot  it has strong ties to our own medieval times  for the typical peasant  you have no hope but to suffer and endure what fate has meted out for you the only exception to this rule is families like the house of brante which while considered a minor house  it has the wealth and opportunity where you may change your lot in the world  if you choose too  b choice and consequence  b you have a lot of freedom to choose but you can t have everything in this story  i found a lot of my picks had trade offs  my diplomacy and valour were high but it came at the cost of my other skills  certain choices will be closed to you depending the route you take and i like that  it actually allowed me to role play sir brante and see the world through the lens of where he is in the world  in my main run  my sir brante didn t accept his lot as a commoner  he defied it  he kissed the sword  he paid for it but he was proud of his choice  he followed his father s footsteps and became a judge  he tried to change the system from the inside  he put others before himself before family and friends  they all had costs and opened and closed various doors  b the story  b i ve always liked dystopia s and the world of sir brante is one  the main events of the game unfurl around you as you progress in life  you do have the option to participate in them although how you participate is defined by your choices  as you progress in the story  the strife continues to build until the crescendo at the end it s like watching the start of a revolution  at the start  the problems feel very far away  my sir brante  participated in the marches  he fought to get his education  it was the start of a long chain of events  when he became a judge your choices and events in the world eventually brings the revolution closer and closer to you until you re forced to deal with it the only thing i didn t like was the endings and i ll touch on that in my nays  h1 ere  nor thar  h1  b the skills  b your skill choices when you re young feed into your adult skills and if i m honest  i didn t really find them useful  since i took the route of becoming a diplomat  i naturally took choices that would give me high diplomacy and valour  i didn t really put much thought into it  the game itself doesn t really give you really high checks until very late in the story  i understand that a game like this needs skill checks but i had 20 diplomacy but because of prior choices the option to use the 1 20 diplomacy check the game tells you about was actually closed off because of prior choices i made earlier in the game  making getting that high moot   h1 nays   h1  b will power  b outside skills and factional standing  you have one final stat and that s will power and sometimes it was the most frustrating thing in the game  you could meet all the requirements for a choice  you ve got the skills  you ve got the right support  you ve done all the prep work  the choice you re about to take is completely in your sir brante s character  however  because of a choice you got railroaded into 2 pages ago that you couldn t have possibly have known you ve now character s now got  5 willpower and their face is too tired to make the right decision  you know  a decision that might be in their fibre of personality that they would take regardless  yes  i get that you need to include mental state but by david jones locker  drink some damn rum and just get on with it  will power at times felt like an arbitrary barricade  you d take hits out of the blue and the very next choice  you know the important one  it s too bad you spent that will power a page ago  you ll have to do something out of character   b the endings  b the story is great  the build up is great  however  i felt like there wasn t actually much choice in the endings  you can side with the empire or side with the rebels  you either hit the requirements or you hit a failure state  i explored as many endings as i could with my character  for the most part it s most serviceable but i dunno  i felt like there could have been more choices i also found that to get my ideal ending  the path was open to me but i d actually have to let my entire family die  sending them away or fighting for them would result in either insufficient willpower or would leave the commoners state be 1 too low  felt a tad bit harsh considering i spent the entire time making sure they stuck together and sacrificed everything to stick together  h1 conclusion  h1 i loved the vast majority of this game  i feel that you would have the best experience if you give your sir brante a few character traits and then play organically and blind and see where the story leads you i would have given this game 9 gold doubloons out of 10 if not for the aggravation of the willpower stat and the more mediocre ending which bumps it down to a solid 8 out of 10 gold doubloons   as good as a bottle of rum  drink these when you see  em if you are a strong fan of role playing and love choose your own adventures  the life   suffering of sir brante is a no brainer  hop aboard this ship  unfurl your sails and start your adventure  there is many a route to explore here  who knows you might even find your own xanadu in these seas a small

138853065,76561198019896848,0,6,894,0,893,2023-06-12,english,"the life and suffering of sir brante  in times of the fall of the blessed arknian empire  obviously  is a text based roleplaying game with an emphasis on choices  consequences  and stat management  the story takes place in a theocratic society originally built on a strict caste system  the main character is born in an inter caste family  his father is a small fry nobleman and his mother is a commoner  lower caste more akin to peasants   this means you have a certain amount of freedom in terms of social growth and at the same time a certain amount of responsibilities and stigmas associated with your origin  you also have siblings with vastly different ambitions  desires  and outlooks on life and society  which promotes conflict inside your family  also  the whole caste thing  while being oppressive  actually allows people to change their caste in certain cases   say  a commoner can get an education and become a nobleman  which makes people question  why even have a caste system at this point   promoting conflict between conservative and progressive parts of society   b also   b  since the country in question is a theocratic empire  all the societal problems are traced back to religious teachings  which  you guessed it  promotes conflict and schism in church  and yes  gods are also real  every person can  for the lack of a better word  respawn three times and after every death you have a brief contact with higher beings  making things even more complicated so yeah  absolutely every aspect of the main character s life is an explosive barrel about to blow up in violent fires of revolt and you have to live your life in it  try to survive  achieve something and find happiness for yourself and the people around you  the last part being the least likely the game revolves around reading text and making choices  these choices affect your stats  both character traits  the skill set  and the amount of fatigue you experience  and stats dictate the choices available to you  you start building your stats up since birth and carry them throughout your life  this is a contentious topic because stat requirements limit your roleplaying options  but they also serve an important narrative purpose   your sir brante is almost doomed to be flawed  he won t always do the best possible thing in every situation either due to selfishness  cowardice  incompetence  lack of resources or simply because he s depressed and tired of all the shit happening in his life  sure  not being able to make an important choice by missing a stat requirement by a single point can be infuriating  but as a result  by the late game your protagonist becomes a complex  interesting character with his own set of regrets  failures  and triumphs  also  because of how good the writing in the game is  most situations and consequences make sense  so as long as you make consistent  in character choices  you will get a cohesive and rather fascinating human being as your protagonist writing is the main reason all of this works  i can t comment on the english translation  but the original russian text is of very high quality  it s laconic  but descriptive  a bit dry  but heart wrenchingly emotional at the same time  the biggest strong point of the text itself is that it feels like authors actually write from their own perspectives and experience  not from the media they consume  when your character is leaving his home to study in the capital  it s written in a way that feels raw  real  and authentic   speaking as someone who actually did leave his home and family to gain an education in another city  descriptions of love and sex scenes  however few of them are here  in this game feel like the author actually has a goal of relating the feeling of physical intimacy  instead of retelling a porno they saw someday  dangerous situations feel close and tense  tragedies hit hard  and every triumph and victory  especially the big ones  feel exhilaratingly satisfying  the tragedy of the brante family  being the emotional core of the story  is particularly well done  every family member is a complex  multi faceted character with both flaws and sympathetic qualities and you see them throughout an entire life of your character  making you feel like you have known them for a long time  there is some stellar character development here and extremely effective tear jerking moments  the game is also surprisingly thoughtful and deep about the religious aspects of society  going way beyond a  religion bad  argument  overall it feels like a dark fantasy political thriller  say  the first law by joe abercrombie  augmented by dostoevsky esque psychologism and introspection also  the presentation with its black and white illustrations  melancholic  and extremely catchy  might i add  music and some fantastic soundbites is great for a text based game  the soundtrack in particular creates a very specific mood for the game as a whole and for the key scenes in it  elevating presentation of course  the emotional impact of a story is subjective and largely depends on the player  but i found my first playthrough to be a genuine journey of self discovery and felt enriched from playing it  the game has a lot of adult themes   but not in a  blood and boobs  sort of way  it s adult in a way that it attempts to resonate with the player s life experience  it s adult in a way that it asks you to reflect on things you have done  people you have hurt  love you have given  victories you have achieved despite every circumstance and tragedy you have endured in your life i whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a deep story based experience and capable of enduring some of the frustrations linked to stat management",2023-05-24,2023-05-24,True,16,0,0.712236583232879639,0,False,False,False

town  infecting a 24 year old nurse named chelsey trader  who eventually becomes patient zero  unlike usual zombie games where the undead are mindless corpses wandering aimlessly  cephues protocol takes a different approach  the mutations in the game are smarter and harness the mind of chelsey trader to control mutations  for a more in depth story  visit https   cepheusprotocol com   h1  b  gameplay   b   h1  b first impression   b it took me a solid demo run and a lot of reading of  how to play  guide to get started with my actual playthrough  i would have preferred a more hand holding tutorial instead  being rusty with my rts controls  i needed some guidance  however  once i dived into the gameplay  it became an enjoyable and gripping experience you are a part of the center for epidemic research and control  cerp  and you start off on a navy warship with a helicopter accompanied with a task force whose objective is to establish a base and bring the city back to normal  your initial team consists of a pilot  devon wright   engineer  alex miller   assault  alan baker  and the mission commander  adrian winter   note that if winter dies during your playthrough  the game ends as she is crucial to the mission  therefore  keeping her alive while combating the pandemic becomes your primary objective the city of san francisco is divided into various zones  each with its own population and the ratio of affected people  including zombies  with your initial crew  you must select a zone  preferably an easier one to operate in  and set up a strategic operations center  the choice also depends on whether you have enabled factions or not  as factions introduce a new aspect to the game the controls are extensive  but with some practice  you can master the quick shortcuts that can be a lifesaver in tense battles  another feature i appreciated was the slow motion option  it proved invaluable as i was learning and getting acquainted with the game mechanics  over time  the game s options started to make more sense  and i was amazed by the depth of content and the countless variations that could occur  b the evolution of playstyle   b after a while  cephues protocol becomes extremely fun to play  it s all about strategizing and adapting to the ever evolving threat  the game rewards you for every great decision you make as you learn its mechanics  but also delivers harsh consequences when you re ignorant  remember  commanding a pandemic situation isn t a laid back task  you need to stay focused  by investing a few more hours  i was able to command my troops better  organizing formations  equipping them with superior weaponry  and devising strategies specific to each zone each building plays a crucial role in the operations  and there is a wealth of variation within each infantry unit  you have control over selecting the arsenal for your troops  determining their training levels  assigning key roles  and unlocking abilities  it s a fun learning curve that you ll be eager to explore cephues protocol isn t your typical run of the mill zombie game  it pushes the boundaries of the genre  say goodbye to predictable  mindless undead and welcome a new level of terror  the mutations in this game are not only relentless but also cunning  they adapt  evolve  and become smarter and deadlier with each passing moment  trust me when i say that you ve never faced enemies quite like these before to emphasize the point  losing is part of the journey in cepheus protocol  it s okay to lose  the real satisfaction comes from learning and discovering how you can improve  after experiencing some fatal losses  i decided to disable juggernauts and leviathans to have more control over the gameplay for longer runs  this allowed me to experiment with different strategies without facing severe consequences  b adapting once you know what you are doing   b to summarize the gameplay experience in one sentence  you can say that cepheus protocol is a game where  the line between survival and extinction is blurred  and the fate of humanity hangs by a thread   now  i embark on my journey as a true commander  devising instant strategies based on live news  paying close attention to doctrine points  and executing in depth troop management to maintain a good balance between money and upgrades  i even utilize carpet bombs to blow up highways and gain an advantage  the attention to detail in cephues protocol is absolutely stunning  especially when using the third person view operator or finally reaching the spec ops the game is definitely a contender for a labor of love with its timely updates and improvements  in fact  while playing and completing this review  i received two new updates  the future looks bright and full of excitement  h1  b  graphics   b   h1 prepare to be visually stunned in cephues protocol  this game raises the bar with its breathtaking graphics  from meticulously crafted environments to lifelike character models  every detail is flawlessly executed  dynamic lighting  atmospheric effects  and seamless animations combine to create an immersive and chilling atmosphere  it s a visual feast that heightens the fear and excitement of battling a pandemic situation  moreover  the addition of the new third person operator truly brings the pandemic stricken city of san francisco to life  h1  b  main pros and cons   b   h1  b pros   b  list         in depth gameplay that allows you to learn and adapt        the stunning graphics        custom audio tracks made my runs much more fun        options to customize your experience and difficulty level        re playability        adequate price ask  list  b cons   b  list         sometimes the optimization drops my frames  no crashes though         the ai model can have some improvements  sometimes the troops fail to follow the obvious path        sometimes micromanaging everything gets overwhelming  atleast for me   list  h1  b  honest rating   b   h1 i had high hopes for cephues protocol  and it didn t disappoint  it s a must play for fans of survival rts games  providing a fresh and captivating experience within the genre  the core gameplay is incredibly enjoyable  and with the continuous stream of new updates  it keeps getting better and better  it s worth every penny rating  9 5 10 b for full review head over to  u united

turtles arcade  during a 1990 family vacation to the tropical paradise that is south devon  i remember literally having  jelly legs  after playing  such was my complete  unadulterated excitement at my two greatest loves of the time combining  you see  my friends  what i was experiencing was the perfect marriage of the two most important elements of the 1990s for any 10 year old  tmnt and arcade games while eastman   laird s iconic heroes in a half shell have since dipped their two toed feet into all manner of gaming genres  there is little argument that they will always be suited best to the beat  em up genre  from the aforementioned 1989 arcade classic  to the beloved 1992 snes release turtles in time and its sega mega drive compadre the hyperstone heist  the lean  green fighting machines are perfectly attuned to multiplayer mayhem  tmnt was made for brawling  more so than the frikkin  simpsons and so  with the genre currently enjoying a major renaissance  publisher dotemu and developer tribute games decided it was high time that leonardo  donatello  raphael  and michaelangelo made their grand return to the mean streets  but in a whole new era  one where the brawler genre has advanced beyond its rudimentary beginnings  is the tmnt brand capable of regaining its button mashing crown  or is it just ninja  ninja  crap describing the gameplay of teenage mutant ninja turtles  shredder s revenge is something of a monument to pointlessness  as we all know the score by now  you pick your favorite characters  and then take to the streets of new york city  laying down a solid green knuckle sandwich on the battalion of foolhardy foot clan members that stand in your way  break some skulls  toss some bodies  face down an end of level guardian  and it s on to the next stage  it s a tale as old as time and  for the most part  shredder s revenge changes very little from the core gameplay of konami s 1989 classic  you gotta know what a crumpet is to understand cricket  and you also know what you re getting yourself into here as it is no longer 1989  the brawler genre has  itself  gone through some serious evolutionary stages since those halcyon arcade years  and in order to bring shredder s revenge screaming into the terrible 2020s  developer tribute games had seen fit to widen each individual character s arsenal of attacks  combos  and specials  as well as fine tune their individual strengths and weaknesses in battle for your hapless opponents  we now have tried and tested button mash combos  various anti air counters  two forms of dash attack  jump and dive kicks  team attacks  and flashy  screen clearing specials  the biggest addition is that of a tactical roll  which has invincibility frames and will prove to be a crucial tool in your battle with the robo ninjas  our heroes are also equipped with several very familiar throws  including the famous mode 7 screen toss  the multi slam  and raphael busting out a german suplex that would make lesnar proud shredder s revenge has sublime controls  effectively designed so that beginners and younger players can get straight to dishing out vigilante justice  while offering hardened brawler fans elbow room for slick combos  juggles  and wall splats  while this makes for impactful and satisfying combat  it must be noted that shredder s revenge does not boast the same precision of a streets of rage 4 or a fight n rage while shredder s revenge is undoubtedly deeper than its tmnt forerunners  its role is that of a  supercharged turtles in time   rather than a groundbreaking example of the genre s evolution  crucially  however  shredder s revenge is committed to an all out effort to ensure that you and your friends are having pure  unadulterated fun  a mission goal that the colorful scrapper achieves with ease shredder s revenge sets itself within the world of the 1987 tmnt animated series  the colors  style  humor  characters  and locations immediately recall memories of the classic tv show   the medium in which  turtle mania  became a global phenomenon  if the faithful appearance of the fab four  voiced by their original actors  wasn t enough  then fans will be giddy with excitement to hear that shredder s revenge is jam packed with characters from the show  ranging from regular villains such as bebop  krang  rocksteady  and the shredder himself  to a wide variety of deep lore cameos when some of these lesser known characters popped up  my jaw dropped  having not had them enter my sphere of reference since i first saw them on tv all those decades ago  i was expecting to see bebop   rocksteady   and was spoiled with an appearance of best girl irma langenstein   but i had completely forgotten about one off characters such as  well  why would i spoil the surprises  tribute games  true to its moniker  has gone above and beyond to make shredder s revenge a celebration of the show s legacy  filling its games with references to the series that will please the most dedicated tmnt fans tmnt  shredder s revenge delivers exactly what one expects  it s a great looking  great sounding  and great playing love letter to one of the most beloved franchises of all time  it lacks the top tier polish and scalpel precise intelligence of streets of rage 4  instead choosing to present itself purely as a retro multiplayer masher   albeit one with a far expanded moveset than its predecessors  as a brawler aficionado  i think shredder s revenge is good  delivered with a passion that veers into great  i don t think it topples the best examples of the genre  but i defy any tmnt fan to play this game without sporting a massive grin on their face  and  ultimately  that s the highest praise it can receive verdict  9

ourselves  sometimes we have multiple ideas  like the choice between angels and demons  angels tell us to be positive  trust and help others  demons tell us to be careful  get some benefits and avoid helping others to avoid getting into trouble ourselves  sometime the demons idea is a good one and sometime it is a bad idea and same as the angels  for example  demons told you to be careful and angels told you to trust  it could be in real danger situation or it is fine to trust it a person could not be a perfect person  we need the demons to protect self and to be realistic  and the angels to make friends  you can make a perfect story for a game but you can t make a perfect story for your entire life unless you live in heaven for now everything in this game is in chinese  wait until the

that have high ambition on career  capricorn sun sign  found at prologue  and is a very nice and simple girl  pisces rising sign   she do have some scorpio thinking  found a bit at prologue and very clearly at chapter 1  which she are not easily trust someone and are very angry when someone betray her  her scorpio and capricorn is to protect and help her to succeed but anyhow this time it caused her fail the most  in prologue and chapter 1   if only purely pisces  she would be very fool on trusting everyone and everything  only luck that can help her   but because of greedy she make the first mistake  at prologue  guan haiyue  sagittarius sun sign  pisces rising sign  is a cheerful  fantasy  nice and simple girl  found at prologue   on chapter 1  found she also have realistic thinking and plan  capricorn sign  and this help her a lot  without the capricorn sign she would be very fool on her job which everything are depend on luck  without any plan   the capricorn sign hold her back to realistic more detail about horoscope  if you didn t know much about horoscope like sun sign  rising sign  etc     b sun sign  b   life objective  inner self  like a ceo  b rising 1st house sign  b   action  behavior  outer self  like a coo  b others signs  the 9 planets and 2nd to 12th houses signs   b    here are multiple horoscope signs represent different aspect  for simplify we just pick a few signs that found it play important rolehoroscope is like a spirit  music  in out mind  when we think our thinking are influenced with the spirit of the music  with multiple horoscope signs in ourselves  sometimes we have multiple ideas  like the choice between angels and demons  angels tell us to be positive  trust and help others  demons tell us to be careful  get some benefits and avoid helping others to avoid getting into trouble ourselves  sometime the demons idea is a good one and sometime it is a bad idea and same as the angels  for example  demons told you to be careful and angels told you to trust  it could be in real danger situation or it is fine to trust it a person could not be a perfect person  we need the demons to protect self and to be realistic  and the angels to make friends  you can make a perfect story for a game but you can t make a perfect story for your entire life unless you live in heaven for now everything in this game is in chinese  wait until the english subtitle update to buy it if you are interested you can try this game free demo  prologue chapter  to see the quality of this interactive storytelling movie  from my experience  the prologue seems to be a good quality interactive storytelling movie and is very different from love is all around  but still not so sure about this game yet  when entering the game chapter 1  i found this is a game that teaches you some lessons about life  personality and reality  this is very meaningful and interesting",2024-02-26,2024-03-06,True,10,0,0.653361380100250244,0,True,False,False

when you only play  5 hours  i personally think it plays very well and is very good for being in alpha  now i will share some of my thoughts positive notes       hand holding i really love how this game does not hold your hand  you just have a red marker on your map   the rest is up to you to figure out  crafting  survival  items  day and night strategy are all on you and i love that  i cannot stand when games give me 30 tutorials rather than just let me figure it out  pine harbor respects the player enough to treat them like they are independent       intro  the introduction was well done and though it lacked music to set the mood i am sure that is on the to do list       atmosphere this game gives me strong silent hill vibes which is a plus  i do think the atmosphere could be set better if it has some ambiance or subtle background music        graphics and design i think this game look really good visually especially for it being in alpha        lore there is not much yet  but there are some newspaper articles in your fathers office at the house that i found interesting  the introduction also gave a good bit of lore from the bus driver  the mine also provides some point of view experiences         gunplay i think the gun play is very nice  its simple but man does the shotgun feel good when you pop one of the creatures heads off  i like the handgun too especially for longer ranged encounters  the game provides you with enough ammo to kill an enemy but also makes it risky if you miss to many shots  if you miss one shot it is most likely no big deal  but 2 or more and you are taking damage or possible dying if you panic  i really think the gun play is spot on for risk reward          end of part one  i really like the idea that the first part ended with  the lore dump and change of the plot was actually really good and makes me excited to see where the story goes negative notes         enemy pathing  i do notice that enemies find it hard to get to the player on certain terrain  and will sometimes just pull a 180 and run away  sometimes this occurs inside the house when defending for the night  while this is not game breaking or even that important it takes the threat of the night away in certain moment when enemies bunch up on each other or run away even though they spotted me          day and night cycle   this has been fixed in newest patch i feel that the day is just a little to short to get enough done  i think it is manageable and not a large issue if the aim is for difficulty  but i found myself only having time to run over to the church  looting a few things and getting back to the house for night fall  i don t think this needs to change if this is the developers intention  but i figured i would put it out there  night time seems to last to long  that or the hordes of enemy s occur way to constantly  i think either the night should be shorter  and enemy count be increased  or keep the nights the same duration and lower the enemy amount or space apart the time between each horde to give the player a little more down time          roaming enemies i like how enemies roam pine harbor and can run into the player  but i feel there may not be enough  the threat of the night is always present but i feel as if the day time brings no more than 2 or 3 roaming creatures  maybe in the future this game will have buildings that can be entered and this may cause an increase of enemies to come naturally but currently it seems like walking around in the day time does not bring many threats          buildings hinging off my last point  i would love to see the town of pine harbor actually be more than boarded up buildings that you cant enter  the only building i found i could enter is the little market  i am sure more will become accessible in the future but currently you can only enter the house and the market through an alley access door   correct me if i am wrong          watch alarm beep beep beep beep beep beepi think the alarm is helpful and i love that i get a sound effect to know when i have to go back home but by the time the watch goes off i am already aware that it is dark out  maybe an earlier alarm would be more efficient  to tell me when the sun is nearly down rather than when i already have my flashlight on         curbs   this seems to have been resolved in newest patch sometimes i cant get my character over a curb to get on the sidewalk  i think its like a pixel to tall for my feet to get over or something  i haven t gotten stuck anywhere yet due to this problem but it feels strange when i am trying to hop from one side walk to another and have to use the cross walk instead to be able to go over a street         end of part one  i wont spoil anything but the enemy at the end of part one seems to have much to low of hp  i think i  killed  it with a few shotgun shots  while its design and plot relevance are interesting i think this fight should have a bit more tension or last a bit longer  also some music would go well with the fight  but i am sure that s already be addressed end notes i think the devs are doing a fantastic job if this is what their  release of an alpha looks like  it doesn t crash  fps may drop here and there but it is playable and enjoyable  i am excited to see what this game turns into  and as an avid horror game fan who is very picky  i like this game already  you got the base formula of the game down and it works  and that more than a lot of games can say especially in today s market i am going to keep updating this review as time goes on  i will add any new negatives or positives that i find while playing and update them if they are resolved from my experience keep up the good

beautiful  quality cutscenes  some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range  food images look so carefully made that i couldn t believe that it was a pixelated image at first  every scene does a good job in supporting the story  combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background blurry effects are applied on the screen  whether it s just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool looking effect for the cutscenes  the game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes  some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments  people that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective  moreover  since the option affects all red colors in the game  some scenes will look weird with the faded color https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2441881358  h3 story  h3 the story is a relaxing one  set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions  every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness  supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment  reading the interaction between characters warm my heart  especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background the storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story  sometimes  an intense moment kicks in  changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions  the fast paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone  increasing the intensity  the ending is told in a similar manner  although instead of an intense moment  it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending  some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense  although luckily  it won t affect the overall experience  h3 the game  h3  b gameplay  b the game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress  your hidden ability to read an object s memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks  ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area  there are some limitations though   some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can t be interacted with until they are discovered  fortunately  they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and or pay attention to the dialogues https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2441881785  b puzzles and minigames  b the rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area  most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in  it s nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time most puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few  i found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area  but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area  something which never happened in other puzzles  it s still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough  but if you happen to get stuck  the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read https   steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails  id 2441883206  b length and replayability  b i finished the game in 9 7h after experiencing all the bad endings  although the game only offers one manual save slot  it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off  a hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game  which might take a long time to find due to its randomness  i found it to be a waste of time though  especially since there isn t much that you can learn from the secret  you ll also be left with more questions than answers  giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type  b problems  b despite the game requires you to restart the game several times  you can t skip the cutscenes  some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don t know how to bypass it  moreover  checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off  wasting more of your time  lastly  the game isn t very clear whenever it autosaves your game  i had to save manually whenever i took a break from the game because of

relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments  the superb effect   everything blends well to make the story stands out  the detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can t be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation  while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions  the game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow

though i was very enthusiastic about the game in the original version  i don t think it adequately conveys how much i like it  i love this game this is going to sound overly dramatic but i m being 100  serious when i say that this game made me believe in myself in a way i would not have thought possible  being able to create a whole series of paintings that appeals to a certain customer group is incredibly satisfying  i never would have guessed i was capable of that  sure  the  rules  that make the customers like a painting are really quite simple  though not at all easy to figure out   and they don t actually have much to do with the content of the painting  but succesfully creating paintings that follow these rules nonetheless boosted my confidence  i really enjoyed experimenting with the different styles  i had a lot of fun recreating the same scenes in multiple styles  and some of my paintings actually look quite nice i still haven t figured out the pen tool  but i used it  very slowly   a whole lot to appeal to the minimalists  with great success    i still would like a finer brush  but  as i said in the original review  being forced to create with the tools at hand forces you to be innovative  i found this incredibly satisfying and it unlocked whole new areas of creativity in my brain obviously  ymmmv  but for me this game is both fun and fulfilling original review  i bought passpartout  the starving artist for   5 during a sale  and i d say it s well worth it  i have played approximately 12 hours so far and i ve reached two different endings  i have mastered expressionism and realism   i look forward to trying to get the other endings i should explain that a  i did not read anything beyond the basic description of the game before i started playing and b  i am very much not an artist  i m a beginner painter with let s say elementary school art skills  if you are more familiar with the game than i was and or if you re an actual artist  you may have a rather different experience with this game than i did i started this game by just  painting stuff  i enjoyed it but didn t sell much  especially past act i  figuring out what the different customer groups are looking for is tricky  they are extremely rude about your art when they don t like it  which is honestly pretty funny   the comments are not always easy to interpret  and i eventually just looked up what it is some of these customers want  it took me a second to realize that the title of the game is spelled without the  e  in passepartout  if you need to look things up  this may be important  at first i felt a little frustrated that i couldn t just paint what i wanted but this forces you to be creative with the tools you have available and i started really enjoying using different methods to create things in hopes of appealing to certain customers  for example  using a ton of thin lines in different colors all over top of each other to create a mostly single color field to appeal to the realists  i was also a little frustrated by the limited color palette and the unavailability of additional tools or brush sizes  again  of course  this forces you to be creative with the stuff you do have access to  but it really would be nice to have a really thin brush  as the smallest brush is really not all that small  compared to the size of the canvas  the only way to get a thin line is to draw a line with the smallest brush size and then paint over it with the background color to make it thinner  which is obviously tedious  though i legit enjoy trying to do it  and imprecise  i also rarely use the pen tool because i don t really understand it  it has a weird lag for reasons i don t quite understand  yet    you can change the width of the stroke while you are drawing but i haven t found much use for that i also had to look up how to sell to ghosts  because apparently this information is hidden somewhere in the game files  that s kind of a fun mystery  but if you re coming to this game as late as i did and you re not reading game updates or wherever else it was hinted revealed that that s where you should look for hints about the ghosts  you re not going to know that without looking it up  even though i have looked up the exact instructions for selling to each ghost  i am still having difficulty with one particular ghost  another one took me several tries  i think that happened because i capitalized the title of the painting when i was not supposed to  so it s definitely a bit of a struggle even when you look it up anyway  if you re into making silly little drawings with a bit of a challenge puzzle element to them  this is the game for you  this is also probably the game for you if you enjoy the challenge of creating actual nice pieces with somewhat crude tools  i lack the skill to do something like that  but i ve seen some really nice pieces uploaded by others because i was late to this game  the sequel has been out for a while already  as i just discovered  i look forward to trying it as well",2024-01-29,2024-03-15,True,8,0,0.639107584953308105,0,True,False,False

components is a good starting point  this is the most important reason why i can wholeheartedly recommend this game  right from the opening sequence partisans 1941 is very clear in what manner it is going to depict the partisan activity  and not a single component here disagrees with the others when it comes to soviet world war ii cinema the existence of two different camps is quite evident  on one hand there are war movies  such as ballade o soldate  ballad of a soldier   or jariskatsis mama  father of a soldier   soviet war movies are slightly revanchist  but still hopeful of rebirth with an optimistic outlook on human psyche  even during one of the most barbaric invasions of recent history  on the other hand  there are partisan movies  such as voskhozhdenie  the ascent   or idi i smotri  come and see   there is an irremissible sombreness in partisan movies  usually depicting the barbaric actions of the nazi war machine fully and we see that not even the soviet people can be defined as  good  partisans 1941 takes partisan movies  depicts the barbarism like they do but also adds optimism and revanchism of war movies to the mix  this works very well from a narrative standpoint  considering alter games are on unbroken land here  with their debut game as well  it is refreshing to have hopefulness  determination  a leader that you can look up to in a work about partisans  it fills the player with a sense of appreciation towards the countless partisans operating during the most horrifying and oppressive invasion in recent history  the gaming medium is perfect for this  characters can talk about taking the war to the nazis in any other medium  but player agency  the manner in which you will carry it out  especially with the various special skills and varied partisans this game offers is what makes it so satisfying  having a choice between rushing a nazi with a knife in your hand  morozov  or picking his head from distance with a fully upgraded avs 36  valya  or making him eat lead through a wall with your buckshot  trofim  and many other options that benefit from different abilities complementing each other massively differentiates this from other media even then  the first thing that grabbed my attention was not gameplay mechanics  but how good our main character  probably inspired by real life partisan commander simcha zorin  looked  he is clean shaven with hair like he just left the most fashionable barber shop in byelorussia five minutes ago  with a determined look in his eyes that says i will eliminate every single nazi from minsk to staroe selo  the thousand yard stare  the downtrodden look  the desperation from hunger and cold so associated with the partisans does not have a place here  this goes for every character  they look  talk and act like they have the hindsight to know these days will pass like any other and they will emerge victorious as i said  partisans 1941 is a game where nothing is out of place tonally  and this extends even to the colour scheme  if you have played one of the numerous wwii fps s taking place in the eastern front  you will already be accustomed to the yellowness of wheat  greenness of pine trees and brownness of the earth  how the game changes this well established formula is subtle  but effective  brightness and intensity of every colour is slightly increased in comparison to usual  and a small amount of shading applied to borders of every object makes them more pronounced  these small changes give the usually depressing soviet countryside a much more humane appearance as a final layer of finish  the ost is composed with the same design perspective that is present in other areas  the music you ll hear the most  url https   www youtube com watch v 5jix  pq5eg  guitar track   url  that plays whenever you re in camp is in the same vein  it s slow tempo  but the notes are crisp and distinguishable  in contrast with the melancholic vocal accompanying it  fully embracing the duality of course  as both a debut game and an indie game  partisans is far from being perfect  ui is sometimes buggy and unresponsive  especially in inventory and picking up items bodies  it is obvious to see the game was designed with stealth options as a priority  the enemy ai can get really stupid and there will be no way to predict if they will function or not in a firefight  camp management starts out interesting for one or two missions  but gets repetitive fast  if you have a completionist streak  you ll find that scouring every map to remove every nazi from existence gets tiresome in larger levels  especially when they start to call in reinforcements  nevertheless  when it works  it works really well  the excitement and subsequent relief of a well executed stealth attack with combined partisans is a feeling that is rarely replicated in gaming and usually passes as a high point of a game  here these opportunities are dime a dozen  the planning it takes to silently kill a dog and its handler  usually a mid tier enemy in most games  is rewarding thanks to the multiple approaches you can take  if you can handle some minor jank  and nothing good ever happens without some minor jank   partisans 1941 is a game that exactly knows what it wants and achieves what it wants and this is nothing to be scoffed at in these times punch a nazi out

on the text here and following my page     url  h1 introduction  h1  partisans 1941 is an isometric stealth game and a modern successor to the commandos series the game and its storyline depicts a fictional tale  taking place on the eastern front in ww2 as you command a group of soviet partisans against the evil german occupiers  so  let us begin  h1 game review  h1 partisans 1941 is an epic stealth game  with great immersive mechanics that allows the player to get lost in the gameplay  a sign of a well made game  you start out as a lone partisan and obtain a perfect opportunity to escape the guards  at the end of the first mission  you obtain new companions  as the game goes on  you encounter new companions  each with a limited story and you embark upon partisan activities to beat the germans the stealth and strategic approach to the tactical gameplay is amongst the best i have ever played in the genre  i wholly found myself enjoying every moment of the game  as well as liking it so much  i spoke about it with friends however  as the game drew to its conclusion  i was found left wanting a lot more  and i felt the game ended way too soon  about 40 50 hrs for the average player   a storyline such as the one the developers were attempting to tell  i feel  could have lasted a lot longer and the gameplay was certainly capable of driving the players on to a game lasting twice as long as it did as i got towards the end of the game  i also encountered a game breaking bug where one of my partisans wouldn t fire any weapon other than a pistol  this issue is almost universal amongst the playerbase  was reported to the developers many times  however  the developers ignored the complaints and did not fix the issue  this  in conjuction with the abrupt ending  left a lasting bitter taste to an otherwise perfect game experience  h1 is the game worth the price   h1 no  i do not think partisans 1941 is worth its non sale price of  24 99  in my opinion  with how many games are now released  one should always seek to acquire a game for under  10 when possible  due to the abrupt ending and a story that was rushed to its conclusion  this game is not a must have now  at any price  had the game lasted 10 missions more  my opinion in regards to that may differ  nevertheless  partisans 1941 is a game that is often on sale on steam or other sites for under  4  at that price  the game is a steal and i would recommend it to anyone who either loves  likes  or may have an interest in a tactical isometric stealth game  h1 what will i get from playing partisans 1941   h1   a relaxing musical score  this game helped me overcome a really nasty illness i was struck down with   engaging and really unique tactical gameplay  an isometric lovers  dream   a good story  but let down by its abrupt ending   ww2 lore  specifically eastern front lore   a game providing immense fun for 50  hours  h1 conclusion  h1 despite its flaws  partisans 1941 is still a really good game  alter games  like all developers  should always fix bugs when reported by the players  and the developers lose marks for ignoring this widespread issue for several years  in addition  the abrupt  rushed ending to the story leaves a bitter taste to  i anyone  i  who appreciates a great story  which  as a writer of fiction  i  b absolutely  b  do the gameplay is rich  and it compliments the strategy tactics stealth genre extraordinarily well  yet  despite its impressively immersing gameplay  at the end of playing the game  i was happy to have played it  yet i was ultimately left wanting more  h1  outro   h1 due to the rushed ending  as well as game breaking bugs being ignored  i must rate this game an 8 10  had i not encountered either issue  i absolutely would have given this game a perfect score       graphics           you forget what reality is   beautiful  stylistic  good  decent  bad  don t look too long at it     gameplay        very good  good  it s just gameplay  mehh
