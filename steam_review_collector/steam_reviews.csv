[b]insight[/b]-which corresponds to prudence and the color white prudence determines the amount of sanity your employees have and is effected by white and black damage if it drops to zero your employee will panic and these effects will change depending on your employee's highest stat  [b]attachment[/b]-which corresponds to temperance and the color black. temperance will effect work speed and success chance and this damage type does both health and sanity damage  [b]repression[/b]-which corresponds to justice and the color pale(blue for some reason) justice effects movement and attack speed of your employees and this damage type deal percentage based damage.  -picking the wrong option on an abnormality will make you more likely to fail working with them. -as you work with each respective stat it will level up which is important for determining work success the higher your work success the more pe boxes you get -each abnormality has their own pe boxes you can use to buy suits and weapon for your employees   and after you finish a day you get to the visual novel section of the game which is where the surprisingly deep story is i will not touch on it to avoid spoilers    [h1]music[/h1]  the music in this game is incredible however more often than not you will not be able to hear it because if an alternate track than the neutral theme (outside of the story tracks) is playing something has gone wrong and may be more worth it to restart the day  [b]i'm not going to be going over the story yet as i haven't seen much of it[/b]   [h1]summary[/h1]  in summary i think this game is worth your time and if your are a fan of these management type of games should totally check out",2024-02-27,2024-02-27,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]the gameplay[/b] is punishing. yeah that's no exaggeration. lobotomy corporation at the very start when you have none of the abnormalities researched is a game of trial and error. you will not be able to beat the game on your very first try. think of it as a rogue-like but when you die you can still restart the day. eventually though you'll hit a major road block i.e: an abnormality might be too strong for your employees to handle that or a certain abnormality breaks out because its guidelines conflict with another abnormality's requirements.  but that's strangely the fun of it because when you restart to the first day certain progress doesn't get lost. sure your employees and your abnormalities may be lost but your research progress on abnos the missions you complete that continue the story for each department and their respective rewards the ego weapons and suits you get from abnos they all stay. so you have this slow climb of power and at certain points you may not even realize you do.   you'll know which abnormalities to take with you and which you shouldn't because of conflicts that might arise or you might even take them on purpose because you want a challenge or you simply want to watch your employees absolutely decimate them with the new gear you got.  this game can be punishing but it's rewarding that triumph you feel when you overcome an obstacle you never managed to hurdle over until now. that's what pulled me into the game and if this intrigues you i highly suggest you get the game.  just be ready to hear the first five notes play again and again until enough employees die and abnos break out. speaking of which this leads me to the next section:  [b]the music[/b]. it's phenomenal there's no questions about it. each warning (there's three) perfectly represents the situation you're in and the music during cutscenes really sell the atmosphere they're trying to go for. the only thing i have a problem with is the music when there's nothing happening in the game also known as neutral 01 to neutral 04. they are all identical in melody. actually it's the exact same song but the difference between all four neutral sound tracks are the additions of instruments into each one. this can work in its own right but most of the time you won't even notice the difference during gameplay until you pay attention to it.  otherwise the music is great. crazy impressive for just 10 people working on the game.  [b]the story[/b] is great. that's all i can really say about it without going into spoiler territory. it can be pretty surface level at some points but as you keep progressing you become entrenched in the lobotomy corp's worldbuilding and its religion and [spoiler]stage play[/spoiler] theming. it leaves off a lot of questions to be answered in their sequel game [b]library of ruina[/b] and i cannot recommend this game more because of the story.  the background art the abnormality artwork and the ego items they're all really good. they're not pure masterworks that award goes to library of ruina but for what it is i like it. [spoiler]there's even a reason later as to why your employees look the way they do in game[/spoiler].  overall this game gets a 9/10. this game is absolutely worth its price and i would have paid more if i could. i hope you enjoy the game as much as i did. just remember to face the fear so you can build the future.  and one more thing if this review sells you on getting it: if you find a small bird with a red stomach a long bird with a scale on its neck and bandaged face and a big bird with many eyes let them all escape at once. you'll get something cool out of it.  just be ready because there lives a beast lives in the black dusky forest.",2024-01-27,2024-02-13,True,24,0,0.744302630424499512,0,True,False,False

just to see if you're doing it right?  turns out they lied. the real game wasn't managing the abnormalities. it was managing the constant deplete in energy the repeated ordeals that just get more difficult to predict and adapt meltdown after meltdown after meltdown praying something doesn't go wrong. that the mimic won't just snap one day and eat your innocent level 5 employee at only -6 overload relapsing the entire 2 hour day. that you won't have to deal with the invulnerable worms next dusk. that the meltdown doesn't target the one abnormality you can't deal with much less all of them. that the tiny white clothed girl doesn't just so happen to wipe out half your facility with a single attack unleashing two of the meanest abnormalities you have under containment triggering a chain reaction of every other abnormality breaking containment slaughtering all your employees through proceedingly more intricate methods. what was i talking about again? right red riding hood sucks. did i mention white and black are now my least favorite colors? i'm pretty sure the facility layout is based on the rings of hell. i survived undertale with the help of a tree but everyone else died and the mimic killed me later anyway. can someone tell me if the memory repository takes your egos away too? man this plot is kinda confusing.  anyway the game is pretty fun. if you're easily drawn into fictional worlds have a life and enjoy persevering through un and im possible odds you'll find that this game is not for you! you will not win the game won't let you. you'll quit within the first 5 hours 10 hours 50 hours and look back on it as a failure. you'll tell yourself you'll finish it one day and never will. even if you do manage to get one ending you'll never get the others. even if you get the endings you'll never get all the abnormalities. even if you 100% the game you'll never be satisfied. you failed. everything was for naught. how do we escape this hell we live in?  fun game.  ||edit|| now that i've doubled my playtime i've learned the truth. this game isn't hard it's actually kind of easy. in fact i'm gonna say it the game is only hard because the hitboxes for literally everything are terrible. that and you have literally no direction for how your supposed to properly manage the corporation. no i'm not talking about the abnormalities if those guys are giving you trouble it's either because you don't know how to read or you're bad at the game described as managing abnormalities. what i actually mean by manage the corporation is grinding your employees to their max capabilities at every moment of the day completing the records department research and his core suppression if you're feeling real spicy then restarting from scratch to construct your own personal army of roided up psychopaths to bonk all your problems away at a moment's notice. once you understand this absolute truth you'll realize that lobotomy corporation is actually an easy game and the only reason people say it's hard is because the tutorial is obscure enough you don't know what you're doing half the time you've no way of telling if the work you're doing is actually training your employees properly unless you download a mod for that and because the majority of these people are a bunch of pathetic babies who don't understand that to enjoy a game you need to spend the first 80% of the playtime grinding at 2 am hating yourself and everything around you. essentially if you have less than 30 hours in this game your opinion is irrelevant and you need to get off the computer grandpa. yes i understand you need to feed your family but this game has a very deep and complex narrative that absolutely requires the 100 hours of filler inbetween it all and you need to suffer through every second of it. anyway just like most people recommend if the game is that hard for you just mod it. there's a very handy dandy guide here on steam that is actually quite simple and concise to the point in which you'll only spend about 10 minutes setting it up. of course it won't help you it will only make the process much less frustrating. just remember if you use the super agents mod you better lock your windows because oh boy do i feel abnormal tonight. if i'm being at all serious if the ending for the game wasn't so painstakingly difficult to reach i probably would've capped my playtime out at 70 hours but man do i love jumping through hoops. you should do it too! ignore the flames and angry man whipping your behind that's just a feature. anyway i'm shooting for around 160 hours after that i'm gonna assume i've absorbed everything this game has to offer because if there's a secret ending d it probably wasn't worth the extra 40 hour grind anyway. i'll just look the ending up on youtube.  - achievements to brag about - 165 hours in - defeated white night for the first time [without confession] 178 hours in - defeated the red mist",2024-01-23,2024-02-12,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]what is lobotomy corporation?[/h1]  [i]lobotomy corporation[/i] is 'vibe' or 'ethos' aside a facility management simulator with control elements from a rts title. the facility in question is the titular lobotomy corporation a sprawling prison for eldritch and supernatural threats. if you're familiar at all with [i]the scp project[/i] you should be recognizing the scp foundation and that's not an accident. the game is [b]very[/b] blatantly a [i]scp[/i] riff albeit with a heavily -- how do i put this -- manhwa webtoon presentation complete with [i]madoka magica[/i]-styled magical girl outfits for your little employees and a poorly-translated jargon-filled misery-porn storyline that takes itself way way too seriously.  coming at the game as an american player the game's overwrought melodramatic daytime-tv storyline cutesy art style and heavy reliance on clicky micromanagement strike as extraordinarily 'korean' but this foreignness to my own sensibilities accentuated rather than detracted from the core hook of the game: its mysteries.  every 'day' that passes in [i]lobotomy corporation[/i] the player is given a choice of three new monsters to add to their facility. initially the player has absolutely no knowledge of the monster up to and including what they even look like. employees then have to 'work' with the monsters in your facility in one of four color-coded interaction options not unlike a hasbro bop-it‚Ñ¢.  do this a requisite amount of times to fill up a power meter. when the power meter is filled the day ends although if you're feeling risky you may instruct your employees to keep playing bop-it‚Ñ¢ indefinitely afterwards because it will make them progressively better at pressing the associated colored button in the future.  however each monster has some kind of gimmick or frequently multiple gimmicks that will cause them to do terrible things to your little employees if you don't know the warning signs. most commonly the monster will break out and start killing people if the wrong bop-it‚Ñ¢ button color is pressed. however some of these gimmicks are considerably more esoteric like a monster that gets jealous whenever any other monster is worked with and so you have to keep working with it to mollify it or a monster that turns the employee working with it hostile and so you need secondary guards around to then pacify that employee.  at first these will seem completely arbitrary to the player; as arbitrary indeed as playing bop-it‚Ñ¢. as the game goes on though the player will accrue the knowledge of what to do and what not to do for each monster while the monster gimmicks get exponentially more complex and the gradually-increasing dozens of monsters in the facility make every subsequent day more heavily micromanaged. near the end of a single run of [i]lobotomy corporation[/i] (about 60-100 hours terrifyingly) the game resembles [i]starcraft[/i] more than [i]prison simulator[/i] with the player feverishly hotbuttoning around and rapidly clicking to put out dozens of fires personally ordering every single one of dozens of employees because there's no automation features.  on the surface this game is the absolute biggest waste of time i could ever recommend to you. a roguelike-styled game that takes 100 hours to complete? and you restart everything if you lose the facility? twodee are you [i]high[/i]?  well the game's rewind system cleverly salvages this.  [h1]rewind rewind rewind[/h1] unlike your typical go back to start with nothing roguelike game loop [i]lobotomy corporation[/i] gives the player the ability to rewind several days back a welcome reprieve if you drafted the wrong monster and it wrecked your facility. it also has the standard 'go all the way back to the start' option although curiously both this and the several-day rewind can be initiated at [b]any[/b] time and not just after losing the facility.  this is because although both options remove your monsters and kill off your employees you [b]keep[/b] everything else: facility upgrades purchased gear for your employees and -- most crucially -- knowledge of what each monster does. the game seems designed around the [i]strong[/i] intent that you'll revert the entire save file at least once: several permanent facility upgrades are locked behind devastating boss encounters that can gut your staff and put you in a poor position to go on and win the game and two of those boss battles late in the game are mutually-exclusive meaning two playthroughs to the endgame are necessary to obtain both associated facility upgrades.  on the second and third and fourth and so on run of [i]lobotomy corporation[/i] the player can breeze through the early levels accruing power freely like how a new game plus works in most conventional rpgs.  this puts the player in a better position for the endgame and each subsequent reset allows the player to accrue more stuff more skills more [i]monster facts[/i]. it's a deceptively forgiving system for this kind of unforgiving game giving the player a massive and potentially game-winning consolation prize for the pain of having to restart everything.  this does return us to the biggest problem of [i]lobotomy corporation[/i] though: it really wastes your time. by the time you're factoring progressive restarts into your power-building strategy to eventually take on the crushingly-difficult endgame you've sunk hundreds of hours into this facility micromanagement sim and are just ready for it to be over. there's light at the end of the tunnel but it's a hundred miles away like a speck on  a black horizon.  i didn't have the endurance to finally power through and finish [i]lobotomy corporation[/i] even if i enjoyed the process of discovery. maybe you can incorporate this knowledge into your run and win where i didn't have the patience to.  [h1]in conclusion[/h1] [i]lobotomy corporation[/i] is an extremely korean facility management roguelike about putting frilly tutus on the [i]scp foundation[/i]. it does not respect your time at all but it at least has the good sense to do some fun things with all of the time it steals like your clingy friend who likes to drink. although the gameplay itself is not particularly engaging the process of discovery is and the game puts a cushion on its sharp 'losing is fun' design philosophy by giving you some nice perks [i]for[/i] losing.  if a little bit of masochism and a lot of time investment sounds great to you right now then i can wholeheartedly recommend [i]lobotomy corporation[/i].",2024-01-19,2024-01-19,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[/spoiler] the way that the game handles these topics is very insensitive and poorly handled. [spoiler] suicide [/spoiler] is a massive focus of the game's story and is shown in graphic detail in several different ways- even in the gameplay itself. there are also items in game that make very insensitive remarks to [spoiler] self harm [/spoiler] which made me very uncomfortable.   this game features many different types of horror in the stories of it's various monsters- from slasher-type monsters to purely psychological-horror inspired entities- but for every unique interesting and familiar take on horror one might also find something done just for shock value which i think takes away from the experience. if you love shock horror and don't care about the game's insensitive handling of topics of mental health [spoiler] suicide self harm and drug addiction [/spoiler] (perhaps if those things just don't bother you) i would recommend the game.   another quick thing to mention is that i would not recommend this game at all if you are looking for a casual gameplay experience. this game is incredibly difficult- and without the heavy use of a wiki will result in many many failed runs before you will likely be able to get too far. the difficulty spike as you progress is a straight-up vertical wall and the game does not hand-hold you with tutorials. it can be very difficult to understand and learn if you haven't played before.   overall i would recommend lobotomy corporation but please remember to be safe when dealing with the  triggering topics and content of the game as i do not believe the game properly warns the viewer of the sensitive topics that it fumbles around with constantly and could cause significant discomfort in the wrong person.",2023-12-01,2023-12-01,True,0,0,0.460251063108444214,0,True,False,False

[i]desperately.[/i] the story told by lobotomy corporation is one i very much enjoy and one that draws you the player in as the participate. there aren't choices to make though; rather the only choices are the ones you come up with to meet the challenges. for the game weaves the story and the difficulty together as you the manager of this strange facility desperately try to comprehend what it is that you are doing here and why.  you will come to love your agents you will suit them up in a variety of colorful equipment and you will send them to their horrible deaths over and over and over. decapitated eaten alive flattened like a pancake ripping off their own head dragged to hell digested by spiders turned *into* an interdimensional spider turning into a giant mushroom turned into a small slime turned into a large slime vaporized pulverized incinerated frozen ground into meat chunks killed by their fellow agents after they lost their minds and had to be put down executed with impunity by the manager... and this is not even nearly close to the many deaths you will see them suffer. you will reset and do it again. the charmingly horrible deaths are a balm of sorts: i remember a desperately frustrating death but watching the individual in question lower themselves into a bath full of blood and grimly deciding i needed to keep going with the day is part of the experience.  this game can be clunky it's not exceptionally polished there are infrequent graphical glitches and a few bugs that i had to go and install mods for (it's not necessary to do so but i wanted to). this game will not be an easy experience but if you are willing to face the fear and build the future you will enjoy it. i think that this game is [u]unrelenting[/u] and absolutely uncompromising but slowly bending it to your will until you stand at the end over a pile of corpses and regrets in bloody triumph is one hell of an experience and one i am so glad i decided to play.

[b]gameplay[/b]  the gameplay sounds rather simple. you have employees who you can send to work with abnormalities to obtain energy to fill the daily quota. depending on the employee the abnormality the type of work and rng you will produce more or less energy and the abnormality will or will not get more unhappy. if an abnormality is fully unhappy bad things happen ranging from employee deaths due to abnormality breakout to... more deaths usually. the interesting part is that after working with a number of abnormalities a meltdown occurs. either it puts a qliphot meltdown on some random abnormalities which can be removed by working with them but makes them unhappy if left unattended or it spawns an ordeal in your facility forcing combat. combat due to ordeals or escaped abnormalities can go from simply sending in a blob of high-level employees to micromanaging to avoid attacks depending on the threat you're up against. all in all the gameplay loop is nicely put together.  [b]boss fights[/b]  there are no story spoilers here but i wanted to tag it anyways. [spoiler]boss fights also known as sephirot meltdowns introduce a gimmick for a day and reward you with a buff if you beat them. they are varied and a nice breakup of the regular gameplay loop and several of them are quite challenging (especially the final boss gauntlet).[/spoiler]   [b]music[/b]  although it's nothing special the music is fitting and doesn't disturb the other elements of the game.  [b]grind[/b]  yes it's one of those. you level up employees by working with abnormalities and in principle days are infinite. you almost have to level agents further than you would just by reaching the quota since later boss fights require a bunch of high level employees to deal with everything going on at the same time. furthermore to get true ending you need to have seen every abnormality and filled out their entire bio. this'll take at least two full runs likely three since rng isn't in your favour and your first run isn't likely to get all the way to the end if you're unprepared.  [b]rng[/b]  oh boy rng. the energy you get from working which abnormalities you get which ordeal you get where the ordeals spawn what abnormalities get a qliphot meltdown this game is jam-packed with rng and at several occasions good or bad rng is the difference between succeeding and having to retry the day (i'm looking at you queen of hatred!). especially bosses can be highly dependant on a role of the dice with a wrong role almost forfeiting the attempt.  [b]conclusion[/b]  story is good gameplay is good until you get to the third run and start to prepare/(grind) for the final boss gauntlet. it's rewarding to complete though and the story makes most of it worth it.",2023-05-08,2023-05-08,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

135879244,76561198024343258,0,2,8687,0,8578,2023-06-10,english,"caution: maybe spoilers. i tried my best to avoid any major ones.  there are few games that properly evoke a variety of emotions of me and even fewer than can engross me so deeply that i start to obsess over the next session of play i so desperately wish to do. let me preface this by saying that this game is far from perfect and it has a lot of things that people will find annoying or downright frustrating. but for me that was part of the package of experience it offered and it all fit into place so damn well. for me this is a perfect game suited to my preferences. i was compelled to write this after having spent 142 hours to 100% the game and attain its true ending.  [b]gameplay[/b]: it's a management game but also much more than that. the game punishes tiny mistakes and poor choices of judgement in brutal fashion. the grind in the later parts of the game becomes arduous making each day feel like a marathon. those mishaps suddenly feel like soul-crushing events that make you feel either you have to make an immense sacrifice to proceed or restart the day and accept that you just wasted a bunch of your time. sometimes even rng factors in and decides that your destiny is to fail and there's little you can do but watch on as things spiral out of control. things like this break the will to play for many people and i wholly understand this. it's an unforgiving game. in terms of combat you literally are just a commander that sends units from point a to b. they handle everything else including any special abilities they may possess. you must simply guide them in the direction they need to go. it's a lot more work than it sounds like and at some points the game becomes heavily micro-intensive. rts players will feel at home.  however what this game does is reward you in dividends for keen observation patience and over-preparation. in strategy games i'm the turtle player. i overcompensate my lack of tactical finesse by developing a powerful base and producing a bunch of high quality units. this is what i did in this game. and this strategy was time-consuming and at times it was tedious. but it pays off. oh boy does it pay off. i went into this game 95% blind. i learned things through trial and error. this game while it does have a manual doesn't have an in-depth guide to every other intricacy it possesses. for some people the best option is to browse the web for guides and tips. this is perfectly valid considering the nature of this game. but i think part of what made the experience so memorable and important to me was being constantly beaten down by unknowns in the game only to rise up and conquer them after observing and learning from my mistakes. maybe i'm a bit of a masochist but the feeling of satisfaction you receive when the things you learn help prevail over a trial you struggled to bypass the euphoria is exquisite.  [b]narrative[/b]: this game has an interesting story that is provided through visual novel cutscenes between the days of play. you unlock new cutscenes via simple progression of days and also completing missions assigned to you. for people that dislike reading visual novels or reading in general the narrative will probably be a miss for you. there's a lot of reading to do. even for those that do enjoy those genres the story is a meticulously crafted one where everyone speaks in a certain way that feels like you're always on the verge of philosophising about existence itself. and most of the time that ends up being the case.  personally as a fan of other series that have similarly overtly complicated storytelling (such as girls frontline) this game felt like a natural fit for me. i became so engrossed with the world that they built through the dialogues and the story of the corporation you worked in. they drip-feed you these details that make you crave for more knowledge and some characters become unforgettable with the way they poetically speak about their story and how they are now. lobotomy corporation is very much a story of facing one's fears to build a future that you can walk into. yes the game's slogan is truly relevant at all times. amazing.  and when it all culminated into the ending sequence and the true ending... i shed tears. it was full of surprises. i was shocked but i was also relieved. i was given a victory lap. i was given a sheer spectacle that unfolded before my eyes in a way i didn't know the game was capable of presenting and i was in awe. a truly beautiful way to conclude a game. i pass my thanks onto the current english translators (i'm aware of the horror stories of the initial translators) for allowing me to experience this wonderful tale. and let's not get into the chills i got from those final lines...  [b]design[/b]: this game has a simple style that works pretty well and it even has an in-universe reason for the way it all looks. at first you will be overwhelmed by the ui and wondering what everything does. you slowly start to learn how everything works however and the important things the game will guide you through via the tutorial. you will likely discover new things about the ui as you proceed through the game and it can only help you. it is very much a game that once you become adjusted to the interface everything then becomes second nature to you.  mechanically the game doesn't have many complex base mechanics. you primarily manipulate time and you manipulate your agents. you order your agents to do work fight escaping monsters move to locations etc. this is the majority of your gameplay loop. the variables which change how these function are the abnormalities. every abnormality is unique and has its own set of conditions to take care of it. this changes what work you do when you do it who works on it etc. it's here that the game truly shines in how varied it can become and how many decisions you end up making. the game will tell you most things about the abnormalities as you work on them so you can trial and error before figuring out the correct method of caring for them.  as for the thematic design the game stands out. it has a unique artstyle that differentiates it from other games and every single of the abnormalities are carefully crafted to be exceptionally unique and interesting. every time i grabbed a new one i truly wondered what kind of atrocities it was capable of committing. some designs are unnervingly cute. some are absolute nightmare fuel. some are bizarre beyond our wildest dreams. it's a truly colorful roster of entities and that's not even speaking about the character cast itself. the sephirah each have their own distinct silhouettes and characters. many things in the game take heavy influences from cultures and mythologies such as fairy tales and kabbalah. those that enjoy seeing creative ideas and inspirations flourish eat your heart out.  [b]conclusion[/b]: i don't usually write reviews. i don't consider myself much of a critic (even though i'm probably qualified for it in some ways). everything i wrote here take it as a different perspective when approaching this game. keep it in mind and develop your own impressions. this is a game that resonates with a certain type of person heavily. it isn't for everyone but you can only really determine this by trying it out. and i truly believe the experience everyone else will have will be unique to them depending on their approach.  i felt compelled to write a review for this because it became one of my all-time favorite games. from start to finish and even beyond finishing it has captivated me and captured my heart. to the extent that i know that there will never ever be another lobotomy corporation. never another game that will be perfectly suited to my desires and that would deliver this amazing experience onto me. and that's perfectly fine because i already have it right here.  now time to hope library of ruina will also capture me so deeply.",2023-04-01,2023-04-01,True,4,0,0.539622604846954346,0,True,False,False

the answer is you don't it happens to you once you restart the day and you never leave your characters in the main rooms when you see that ordeal coming up ever again.  now i may have been going on the negatives for awhile but that's because they're pretty bad and also specific.  otherwise the story is great. i love the writing for most of the lore in game. i think the progression system is extremely unique and good once you understand how it works.  the artwork is great and most the anomalies feel unique.  a lot of anomalies also have their own unique mechanics which makes the research side of the game really interesting and fun. every anomaly is its own puzzle.  the difficulty of the game mostly comes from the lack of understanding so once you've researched every it's naturally easier to progress even if you day 1 because you know what anomalies serve you best.  the biggest down there is how vague the game is with outcomes and rng which is part of why i recommend more detailed info. knowing the levels of your characters is also vital for stat farming and even some later objectives not base game you need more detailed info for that.   together i think lobotomy corporation is a very good but incredibly flawed game. for me i think it's worth it but for others maybe not. it's a cautious recommendation.  edit edit: i'm mad i was mostly positive about this game until day 46. all you need to know is due to in game mechanics i need to replay 45 days to get the true ending because rewind to the memory repository is an awful mechanic you should just be able to select previous days. i'd like to stress again this isn't a hard game it's a tedious one. so i've given up (again this isn't even taking into account my 5-10x speed multiplier).  if you want the game for the gameplay i can recommend it it should last a solid 20-30 hours.  if you want the game for its story look up the game's story on youtube i'd go as far as to say this game is openly disrespectful of your time spent with it. if you want to read up on the lore of the anomalies look at the wiki.  i mean this wholeheartedly that you should never play this game if you want any of the writing you shouldn't touch this game just view the writing. the only reason i've not changed to a negative review is because i recognize that the game is super fun before you learn every single anomaly.",2023-03-18,2023-03-21,True,95,6,0.736680567264556885,0,True,False,False

(i won't say any more as it will spoil certain elements of the sequel library of ruina. i will say what's said in lobotomy corporation though.) angela filled with anger from the torment she's been put through due to the time loop wants to live a normal human life. she turns off the tree of light taking the light for herself and using it construct a library where she may accumulate knowledge of the world the city everything.   10/10 game and i don't give that out lightly. well at least i don't when i'm seriously reviewing something. it is a jankfest there are bugs at every corner but those are easy fixes with mods made to debug the game. play this game if you want to cry form happiness conclusion closure anger disappointment practically every emotion that can make you cry in this game will make you cry. after you're done play it's sequel it's somehow better than this.",2023-03-07,2023-05-24,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

128447195,76561198041694823,0,3,11161,0,10887,2023-06-19,english,"the gameplay is fairly simple to grasp. you have an abnormality who is sitting in a nice little containment cell. you have an agent who needs to gather energy from it. you chose what type of work to perform and that's it. you watch the little guy go and hope for the best. if you're a good manager this game will become routine almost tedious in its design. if everything is performing as intended all you do is schedule your little guys to do their little works and once you've got enough energy you move on to the next day to continue the story. but not everything goes as you want it to.  every single abnormality has its own list of rules that must be obeyed. this abnormality kills you if your work time takes too long. this one gives you a gift but if you work on another abnormality while carrying its gift you die and turn into a horrible monster. this one doesn't like repression work. that one hates employees with high temperance. these are all rules you'll have to tuck away into your subconscious as you play the game. forget any one rule and you're likely to have an employee die. i once had spent a few hours on a single day trying to grind my employee's stats to maximum for upcoming challenges. i had one employee work with a safe abnormality who gives a little healing orb for doing work. it's not an abnormality that's good at training stats however so i sent that employee to work with another to finish off her stats. to my dismay i forgot that anyone carrying the orb is likely to die if they work on any other abnormality. not only that but any employees who got the orb throughout the day also die when that happens causing 5 deaths in my facility of 20 employees.  but this is where the game really starts to shine in my opinion. you can retry at almost any time. those 5 employees are back under my care as though nothing had ever happened. i was a bit aggravated to lose my employees but it was my fault. fundamentally lobotomy corp does not present the player with impossible tasks. there is never a case where an employees death is a requirement to progress. some challenges can be made easier by throwing a few corpses at it. one of the hardest challenges in the entire game can be made trivial if you're willing to commit to sacrificing a single employee but it's never a requirement to progress. a deathless run is more than doable. everything comes down to player knowledge. in that way this game is a little bit like outer wilds. your own knowledge is one of the strongest weapons at your disposal.  but then it gets even better. every 5 days the game saves to something called the memory repository. any gear you've unlocked quests completed research gained and upgrades acquired persist when returning to the memory repository. that one sacrifice to cheese one of the hardest encounters in the game? that employee too can come back. the challenge will still be cleared. and you will have new resources available further challenges even easier. you can go through a week farm a bunch of high level gear and return to the start of the week with everyone alive and now decked out in the high level gear you just earned.  and so eventually we return to the status quo. my entire facility is now flooded with level v agents with maxed out stats and ego gifts. my facility is so powerful we can set dangerous aleph class abnormalities free for fun and easily suppress them without a single lost employee. and so the game has returned to that tedium i mentioned before. if you're a good manager nothing will go wrong. if nothing is going wrong then all you're really doing is farming energy and moving along. the game has two ways of co this fatigue. ordeals and missions.  missions are challenges set forth by the other characters in the game. most of these are pretty easy but some can be quite challenging. one of them is suppress 3 different aleph class abnormalities in a single day. for someone like me with a small army of super units decked out in the best gear thanks to judicious use of time travel this is fairly trivial. but for most players this is a wall that will be nearly insurmountable. they also reward you with permanent upgrades.  the second mechanic is ordeals. these are essentially uncontained abnormalities that appear randomly throughout the day. the game gives you a warning before they spawn and the player themselves must trigger the event by performing work. the first time you encounter an ordeal it will likely be a nightmare. you won't understand what these clowns are. you won't be in position to stop them and you won't understand why der freishutz just shot a bullet down a hallway and killed half your employees. eventually you'll learn that the clowns spawn in random hallways but only one per department. you'll learn that their goal is to either breach or trigger the special ability of an abnormality in their hallway and you'll learn that you can easily hard counter them by placing one employee per hallway ahead of time. and that's only  crimson dawn one of the easiest ordeals to handle. thankfully though every single ordeal save one is just like this. they have a very obvious counterplay and once you understand it you won't lose an employee to it ever again. except for violet midnight. if you see violet midnight just hit that retry button i guess. it ain't worth it.  and thus we once again return to the norm. you've completed the missions you know how to handle ordeals your abnormalities are safe. and then the game starts throwing something else at you that pushes you to the brink. suddenly you get a challenge where all your work orders are scrambled. your employee stats are lowered. healing is disabled. a skilled player will not be used to putting out fires. they'll prevent the fires from happening in the first place through diligent management. and then the game sets off an inferno and tells you adapt or die. these are some of the most fun challenges the game has to offer but also the most difficult. these moments are stressful tense and you'll probably have to retry some of them several times before you clear the challenge but at the same time the catharsis once you do is one of the best. and remember all of the above is still in play during these challenges. abnormalities still need work.  i could honestly say as much about the story as i've said about the gameplay. i found the characters endearing and charming. the abnormalities are as much a character as anything else in this game and most of them are lovely. my personal favorite is probably censored. an abnormality that pokes fun at all those childishly written scp articles where they try to add mystique and danger by just spamming [redacted] all over the page. the abnormality itself is a giant censor bar because it's so horrifying to look at that even you the manager would die just seeing it. top class stuff. despite its arguably horror roots and shocking violent content the game isn't afraid to be a bit cheeky and playful with it all. the game's setting is one that will sneak up on you. the true nature of the city and the world they all live in is fairly compelling anti-capitalist stuff. one of my favorite abnormalities is a blind birth with a crooked scales of justice hanging on its neck. the bird cannot tell that the scales are crooked because it is blind. absolutely flawless symbolism.  the music is also great. there's only like 10 tracks total but they're all wonderful and never get grating despite looping constantly. the graphics are clumsy and the game is a bit poorly programmed and janky in spots but everything else fantastic.  tldr: lobotomy corporation is a tough but ultimately fair game with lots of replay value wrapped in a great story with sometimes tedious gameplay. surprisingly well balanced in spite of what others have said about vertical difficulty spikes or impossible challenges. 9/10 i could have gone on but i ran out of space. oops.",2022-12-13,2022-12-13,True,51,1,0.825841307640075684,1,True,False,False

[h1]story[/h1] i loved the story setup and gradual unraveling alongside the events happening in the factory itself. the characters lore and general worldbuilding were all intriguing and left many open questions that i hope are even further explored in the sequel (library of ruina). that is not to say the story was completely open-ended. i thought there was a concrete conclusion to this game itself which i thoroughly enjoyed even as it set up the sequel in the epilogue.  the story is short relative to the amount of gameplay time necessary to get the true ending. so if you discover you do not enjoy the gameplay it is absolutely not worth the amount of gameplay required to see the full story unfold.  [h1]gameplay[/h1] i thought the combination of management with roguelike mechanics and some permanence (you keep a few things such as abnormality information and equipment across resets) made for a really fun experience. the retry/reset mechanisms also provided a ton of room for freely experimenting. the boss and mini-boss fights were all unique and provided some clever uses of all the game mechanics which could really require you to change up your strategy and adapt.  i do not typically play management games. i actually discovered this one due to finding out it was the prequel to ruina. i have not yet played ruina since i decided to play them in order. however i do at least know the gameplay is completely different (card-based vs. management).   [h1]soundtrack[/h1] the ost seemed quite small but it blended really well into the ambiance considering it is on loop throughout most of the playthrough as you navigate each day. i never felt distracted or annoyed by any song despite hearing them countless times.  [h1]graphics[/h1] the graphics can look outright silly and goofy at times especially considering the dark events going on. there is an in-story explanation for why things look the way they do and you even get glimpses of what things really look like as you progress.  that said i thought the general graphics and designs were fine in the grand scheme of things. the more artistic pieces littered throughout which depicted the true gritty reality looked phenomenal!  [h1]cons[/h1] there was one big con which i thought was worth mentioning: some of the ui can be [i]too[/i] vague or lacking in certain information. here is a non-exhaustive list of examples off the top of my head:   1. the success percentage for each type of work does not show up anywhere in the in-game ui. i had to always look it up on the wiki if i wanted to know.  2. the game gives no indication of how many hits a weapon does per attack. a seemingly weak weapon might actually be really strong despite it showing low damage values because of a high number of hits per attack. the game only shows attack speed which is separate from number of hits per attack. i only discovered this one late into the game when i started checking the wiki.  3. there is no dashboard to easily check each agent's status including shields. you can partially work around this one by selecting any unit and shuffling through the departments that way although that view is lacking shield info or the ability to select an agent (as in the view you get when you click them).  i know some of the information limitations (especially agent statuses) may have been intentional and are part of the handicaps you get at times. still i wish they were more clearly visible when they were not intentionally being hidden as part of a challenge since information is a core part of the gameplay. the bright side is that the wiki is rich in information and makes it possible to get a lot of the missing in-game information easily.",2022-12-04,2022-12-04,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]mwah![/i] i got into the game because i absolutely love monsters. the game goes into a lot of detail about how they function and has stories connected to each one of them. i love their mechanics and how some are interconnected to each other both story-wise and mechanically. if you're looking into this game for the monsters i would also highly recommend reading the company's comic wonderlab. it takes place during the same time as this game and also focuses heavily on the monsters.  now this game isn't without flaws. truth be told it's a bit spaghetti coded this was the company's first game after all. it does have a memory leak problem but this can be circumvented by just closing the game and reopening it after 3 hours. there are also a few bugs but nothing too game breaking. the most game breaking bug is [spoiler]the different abnormality on first day glitch which can be accidentally triggered and could be an instant restart if you're unprepared for the chosen abnormality.[/spoiler] however one really funny thing about it being like this is that you can easily access the game's files including [b]every single text file in the game.[/b] i have personally renamed all the abnormalities and a few of the ui texts.  all in all if constant grinding and failure isn't your thing it's best not to get the game. if you wanna know the lore for library of ruina without playing there's a playlist of the entire story on youtube you could watch. but if you're alright with failing and getting back up again to push forward this game will be a wonderful and thrilling experience for you and is definitely worthwhile to play.",2022-11-27,2022-11-27,True,34,0,0.74397432804107666,0,False,False,False

as well as complete bonus objectives relating to the story's npcs (the sephirot/sephirah). completing these bonus objectives unlocks optional [spoiler](but required for the true ending)[/spoiler]  challenges to complete as well which will reward you with minor and or major boons for the rest of the playthrough if they are overcome. some of them are extremely difficult though and will only get harder as you complete more.   in summary you have to research new abnormalities deal with existing ones overcome the ordeals and complete the sephirah challenges. well to be fair all you have to do is generate enough energy each day by working with any and all non-tool abnormalities but that's not the real experience of the game of course.   that's putting it plainly though. you will be tested and challenged and quite possibly be put into situations where you cannot realistically win. good thing though - you can restart from day one and keep most of your progress including abnormality dissolution and e.g.o. equipment (weapons and armor). the game is hard possibly the hardest i've played and 100% completed taking me 171.5 hours and there's only 50 days/levels in the game.   the abnormality design is really good. i simultaneously was excited for and dreaded each new one all the way until the last. there are sentient and non-sentient (tool) abnormalities extremely dangerous and mostly passive abnormalities as well as helpful ones too.   the story was fine. i didn't pay close enough attention though because it took me 171.5 hours and about 3 and a half playthroughs (quotes because they were basically mandatory for 100% completion and not full playthroughs like most games) but from what i gathered it's about a nearly apocalyptic and chaotic world where power and influence seem to mean everything and no line is too far to be crossed.   the game can get buggy at times and the ui can be difficult to work with but not to a point where it can make things too hard to deal with just uncomfortable. the game will also get lower and lower fps as the days go on which will make it harder to control things but it wasn't unmanageable.   soundtrack was good really good at times but for the majority i had my own music playing (as you tend to do after so much time).   difficulty is optional if you don't really care about 100% completion or the story that much. if you don't care it's pretty normal. if you care about the story it can be quite difficult. if you want 100% completion be prepared to spend nearly an hour on each level near the end and have to retry a good amount of things dozens of times. i played pretty much completely blind and without guides so that was just my experience. i honestly wouldn't discredit people if they needed some help coming up with a strategy for some of the challenges in the game and looked some things up though brute force actually came through for me some times.  easily one of my favorite games definitely top 10. could never have imagined how long it would take or how difficult some of the challenges were going to be 171.5 hours ago.  upon reading more reviews i should mention that the game's difficulty is not the typical blend of hard. some people are going to find that forgetting to press a button every 120 seconds and multiple people dying because of that is not hard but tediously mundane and that's okay. if mechanics such as those turns someone away from the game then it's no one's fault it's just not something they want to deal with. this game is much more unique than others and not meant for the majority of people and is not relaxing at all which is the point of reviews and gameplay videos.

[h1]pros:[/h1] - the graphics now chibi like characters compared to older that like doodle lol - we can customize our agent but with lob points (i thinks its annoying we must pay for it lol) - every anomalies is uniques and we must using try and fail methods to understand how to handle one anomalies - the story seems clearer than past updates now we maybe can get some fanart/fanfictions here lol - the gameplay is simple but solid upgrades can be obtained if you complete the side missions in each days [h1]cons:[/h1] - well this game lacks many 2d base management have such as easier to choose which characters you want to focus with autonomy anomaly room/lobby/corridor placement (this one is annoying since i liked everything next to each other to make it easier to manage but the game place it randomly and scrolling up and down is tiring especially there is huge breakout) - if you face the chicken cloud anomaly there is a chance agent inside other anomalies room sleeping there and theres no way to wake them up if you not wake them up they counted as death. unfair i think - also same anomalies as above the game not telling you you can wake some agents with rapid click around their feet lacks of informations popup to what we can do or not. - the selecting certain agents rts style sometimes good but sometimes bad agent move too often to pick the right one we want to move and one to stay. - the rmd of moving agents to room sometimes hit and miss especially to opress one anomaly - theres no indicator of who is opressing who. sometimes get you feel annoyed to supress two anomaly in one division. making harder to split team to opress - the clerk (uncontrolled npc agent) sometimes can help fights or just being feeder dirtying the rooms. annoying. - lack of other things to do there should be barracks where weapons to agents to supress anomalies theraphy room to make agents calmer medic to heal agents pantry to feed agents small healing and stamina recovery toilets/wc to reduce stress and recover stamina for agent turrets or automated locking wall protocol to prevent anomalies going further to surface etc. this game just repetitive after 3 hours of playing. almost no variant - the upgrades above is there in game but came as sop that you must choose between days. - days in game should progressive not we need to end it things. anomalies also added if we added room for anomalies thing also more deep about making room for anomalies that if suitable to them they less likely to breach adn easier to cooperate. add maintenance to room also. [h1]conclusion[/h1] yes as i mention above the game is really simple and hard lol. so quickly finish gathering anomalies energy and end the day is the best way to play the game we can't really enjoy seeing the anomalies and managing agents and how the facility works. the game felt like tower defense than base management honestly. if the dev still want to add new mechanics considering adding those i mentioned above. it could make the facility management more fun and not felt like rushing.",2022-09-21,2022-09-21,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]cons:[/b] - prepare your patience because many and many times your patience will be tested as it will take a long time to learn all the rules of the anomalies and for that it is necessary that the employees have contact with them without knowing the rules in the first times so mistakes will be made a considerable number of times but nothing that patience cannot solve.  [h1] game mechanics[/h1] thus begins the journey of our protagonist a new manager where we have every day that manages a group of employees with up to five members for each of the departments sending them to the dangerous task of contacting the anomalies and making them happy  thus producing energy. each of the employees has four attributes fortitude prudence temperance and justice these attributes can be improved with points between days or by repeating jobs that have the same color as the attribute you want to improve. these attributes are vital as many anomalies need a minimum value to accept the employee's presence without killing them outright. ^^  which brings us to one of the main points the anomalies beings or objects that present one or several powers of supernatural origin being classified in five levels according to the risk being them from the safest to the most dangerous zayin teth he  waw and aleph with the first level being the easiest but as the level progresses they start to have more complicated rules requiring for example minimum levels or in some cases even that a certain attribute is not above a certain value if no the anomaly becomes very interested in the employee's life for reasons that are nothing pleasant. ^^  [h1] art and sound[/h1] at this point i must start by congratulating the people responsible for the art of the south korean studio projectmoon for having made an art that i think perfectly matched the theme of the game as it is an art that combines the cute and the shady and at the same time it's interesting and well made whether it's the different departments the equipment made from the anomalies the anomalies themselves and the many unique ways that each anomaly can kill. another congratulations to the soundtrack part i liked it and i think the songs are very pleasant as well as i think they made good choices regarding the sound effects. ^^  [h1] conclusion[/h1] lobotomy corporation was a surprise to me when i saw it for the first time i remember that it was at a very early stage of development and that i bought it when it was more advanced and i was really satisfied with what i saw still in development until the completion of the process creating the game we have today. undoubtedly it is a game that i strongly recommend for anyone looking for a very different management experience with a dark and at the same time very interesting story very charismatic characters with their quirks beautiful arts and the large cast of anomalies created by the studio no it's an easy game and patience will be tested but i guarantee the final experience will pay off. ^^ ",2022-08-30,2022-08-30,True,14,0,0.683162271976470947,0,True,False,False

(if its any clue that the writers are into something day 1 [spoiler] they throw at you the terms sephira and malkuth and there is an obvious graph resembling an inverted tree of life on the department.

(looking at you valheim)  overall i'd give this game a solid 8.8; the story is fantastically jaw-dropping and had me going what the f*ck and holy sh*t at least 17 times with it's several twists and turns and i personally enjoyed the gameplay even if it's not for everyone but the downsides of poor optimization and lack of polish at times is a bit too detrimental to the game itself at times.  if you think this game seems like your type don't be too bothered by my warnings and definitely go for it. it's quite an experience. but if it doesn't look like it then try picking it up on a sale.",2022-04-10,2022-04-10,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

'combat' can also be difficult to manage with some monsters/bosses requiring you to maneuver your agents precisely to avoid instant death - which the controls definitely don't lend themselves to.  the last few levels in particular are an extraordinary challenge and i somewhat doubt most gamers will have patience to see the true ending.  however even if you can't quite make it to the end (like me!) it's still worth it to go as far as you're willing and able before resorting to watching the cutscenes elsewhere.  the game's excellent worldbuilding leads nicely into the studio's well-done sequel library of ruina which manages to feel enjoyably similar even with an entirely different genre and style of play.  overall this is a fantastic game that you can sink plenty of hours into and one i may replay someday when i have the time and patience to try and beat the last few levels on my own.",2022-02-02,2022-02-02,True,13,0,0.656783998012542725,0,False,False,False

[spoiler] gebura [/spoiler] made me a little too frustrated and [spoiler] binah [/spoiler] finally really broke me. i read that the later days are even worse so i simply just gave up and watched the rest of the story on youtube. seeing how insane they got made me a little regretful but at the same time glad that i didn't have to deal with that shit lmao. that said...  i'd like to preface by saying that when people say the artstyle/music is good they're obviously being subjective and there's no need to say that its their own opinion. but it is amazing and i enjoyed enough of the soundtrack organically that i can appreciate a lot of the music tracks outside the game way more (even though on youtube/soundcloud you'll find that there's literal tens of them there's a lot). the characters are very stylish and the whole hebrew naming scheme in a lot of the game's lore is something i've never seen before so it was a very fresh and cool experience to the usual anime stuff i've consumed lately.  i can't wait to hop on to library of ruina now which i hear is easier needing less reaction time and management skills (which isn't my forte). it being a card game is a big bonus since i like theorycrafting in those. knowing nothing about lor i still think i enjoyed a majority of my time spent with this game. if you like a well written story and expansive lore world building (both distinct things) you'll have a good time.",2021-11-06,2021-11-08,True,25,0,0.732568681240081787,0,True,False,False

withstanding  a bunch of still shot images hamfistedly explaining the myriad of this games systems is worsened by using an esoteric vocabulary for pretty much everything. within the first 10 minutes mechanics with monikers such as e.g.o enkaphlanktyn quiploth counter and p.e boxes are thrown at you as if you are already extremely well versed in jewish mysticism. i imagine more than 70% of the people willing to try this game will be put off by how overwhelming this all is. combine that with the fact that its best to look up as little as possible to truly immerse yourself in the game's mystery and you've got yourself a deadly dichotomy at least as far as player retention goes.  this issue comes back to that phrase i used earlier jank. there's more than a handful of places where the mechanical flow and quality of life of this game could be greatly improved upon. even down to just naming conventions for example the 4 employee stats are named fortitude prudence temperance and justice which are all improved by doing the equivalent work types on monsters: instinct insight attachment and repression.  there's no reason for these stats and works to have different names besides flavor. don't get me wrong i'm all about going to flavor town but not when it comes at the cost of unnecessary obfuscation. some things also just straight out aren't explained and i didn't even find out until over 100 hours in that you could highlight an employee and then right click on a monster to send just that employee to go work on it despite that employee not being in the same department. its also never explained that the more damage from a monsters matching attack type the more you will gain exp of that specific stat.   in the end it comes down to what you're willing to put up with for the payoff. this game is hard and attempts to put you in the fetal position every chance it gets. there's a few things you can do to help iron out the kinks such as the more information mod which gives you actual percentage values for everything in the game instead of  generalized phrases suggesting your work chance success. and while i didn't use it myself (and now wish i had) there's a mod that increases your chance of getting ego gifts (unique cosmetic perks given at extremely low odds like 1%) which i think would balance out the games absolutely brutal difficulty for a lot of people.   this game will probably always be niche all of project moons games might be unless they figure out how to teach their players their games. but if you can trudge through it all and take the time to learn the game inside and out upon reaching the end you'll look back upon one of the most unique and memorable experiences the medium currently offers.   its a weird position for me to be in because on paper i would never just recommend this game to anyone casually. but if you're the kind of person willing to make the dive face the fear and build the future then definitely try it out. i think you'll know in the first 2 hours if its something you'll enjoy.",2021-09-30,2021-09-30,True,62,2,0.840540707111358643,1,True,False,False

98286272,76561198089235226,0,19,26666,0,21778,2022-11-16,english,"this game was made for a very specific type of person and that person is me. despite the grind despite the jank and despite the slow start to the story this game has managed to soar right to the top of my all-time favorite games because despite all its flaws it manages to create a unique experience that literally no other game can provide. gameplay: it boils down to this: get a new scp-like entity every day; send little men to research them and gain their essence; turn this essence into unique weapons and armor that helps you survive stronger entities all while collecting daily energy quotas. sprinkle in some combat avoid containment breaches and generally try to avoid casualties. story: the story is great when you actually understand what's going on but the game presents information to you in a confusing almost backwards way often stating things without explaining them until much later. what i will say is this: first off the writing starts out pretty 'eh' but slowly gets better over the course of the game until things get pretty crazy. secondly unless you're paying very close attention the whole time i would recommend rereading the latter half of the game's dialogue after you've beaten the game- not necessary but it's really easy to miss important stuff. the grind: this game's grinding isn't that bad but it is there so you ought to know about it. there are 4 color-coded stats 4 color-coded work types and 4-color coded damage types. if one of your little men does red work for example their red stat would go up at the end of the day. it's really just a matter swapping people around who need training in different areas though at the end of each day you also get a number of points you can use to instantly level people up. difficulty: this game can seem really intimidating for new player from all the information on-screen but you only need to pay attention to a few things at a time and it quickly becomes second-nature. unit control during combat can be pretty unintuitive and while microing is very possible it can be a little tricky to learn for the first time. the game mostly expects you to set up squads beforehand that are resistant to the damage type of your enemy and retreat if things get too hairy. the game itself starts out pretty relaxing honestly but slowly becomes more and more stressful as the days progress. as for actually *completing* the game let's just say it will be time consuming and brutal... extremely brutal. [spoiler] day 49 took me 24 hours over the course of 4 days to beat. that's what i get for trying to do it without any casualties. [/spoiler] that being said if you're willing to play through the game several times and do a lot of stat grinding along the way then keep at it relentlessly until you succeed. so yeah if this game sounds interesting to you i would highly recommend you give it a shot. it's a long game: it took me about 300 hours to beat but i played so much of it because i thoroughly enjoyed (almost) every second of it. you could also totally beat the game way faster than i did as i wasted a ton of time. the sequel to this game library of ruina is another legendary game that is also worth checking out even if you're not into the gameplay of this one. this game goes on sale for $10 every once in a while so keep an eye out during the next big steam sale.",2021-08-27,2021-08-27,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False

all manner of eldritch abominations godless horrors screaming masses of flesh and the odd what if this fairy tale was fucked up creature here and there all collected under the umbrella term abnormality. after selecting an abnormality for the day you take your agents and select one of four works to perform on the abnormalities such as instinct work to feed them or insight work to learn how they work which produce e-boxes that fill a daily quota that rises slowly with each new day. once enough e-boxes have been collected the day ends and you're granted a score that allows you to hire new employees or improve the stats of older ones. following this you're allowed to expand the departments where the abnormalities are kept and given research tasks by the a.i's who manage them to help gain an edge and the next day begins.  however working with the beasts and ghouls that are imprisoned within the facility is far from easy- if the monsters aren't trying to break free from their bondage then they're doing some kind of horrible other thing to your workers. each abnormality is completely unique in their containment measures and much of the learning process of the game is figuring out how to keep each critter under lockdown lest they bust out. these containment procedures can be anything from don't do this specific type of work to don't work on this abnormality if you have an agent level lower than v to working with this abnormality after working with this specific other abnormality will cause the former to breach which makes each terror wonderfully unique and memorable. as you work on abnormalities more and more you unlock greater details of their containment from their true name their disposition towards certain kinds of work to hints on how to keep them contained. even better once you fill out the managerial guide for taking care of an abnormality you can cash in the points you earn from working with them to craft e.g.o. armor sets and weapons or receive powerful stat-boosting gifts. these look bad-ass plain and simple and it feels excellent to finally master an abnormality long enough to make a devastating new weapon or effective suit for your agents to wear. watching your employee force go from barely-equipped bozos who can't even handle a single attack robot to a mob of freaks ripping apart anything that moves feels awesome and rewarding. the loop of getting a new abnormality mastering its containment and then reaping the rewards of keeping it in your facility feels very rewarding though it does become very tedious after a while.   you might be wondering if the entire game is about learning how to manage the abnormalities what happens when you learn how each one works? the answer is that the game becomes rote and tiresome as you go through the motions of assigning work and watching a bar fill up with little in the way of stimulation. there's little risk for each abno breaking out if you're diligent with your work which makes for a management experience that is pretty darn tedious. combat fares no better- while your agents can fight against the escaping abnormalities and the occasional invading force the microgame of controlling your units mostly consists of left-click dragging your entire force right clicking on an enemy and waiting until their hp drops to zero. if the enemy is particularly dangerous then you have to learn to highlight said allied force click a room away to force your guys to move out of the way while the enemy attacks and then left click them all again and move them back into place. it's like playing [i]dark souls[/i] in the form of an rts and it sucks. even worse are the lack of assisting features. there's no way to select your troops and create groups (which would be very useful since many difficult lategame encounters involve splitting up your attacking force into different damage types) no way to automate the work process with each abnormality and nothing to do but watch your employees hit stuff until it dies while ordering them out of the way if things get spicy. combat thus becomes more tedious than fun which means the management and the combat aspects of the gameplay are both pretty boring. combine this with a game design that emphasises grinding for hours on end and a difficulty scale that could be charitably called schizophrenic and you have a recipe for a game that loses its luster very quickly. the sheer tediousness with which the basic gameplay of lobcorp conducts itself is a major turnoff for me and makes it hard to play the game for long period of time when meaningful progress is my objective for the day.   speaking of difficulty lets get back to that subject. lobcorp is hard. like a high-tier abnormality breached? restart the day tier hard. i have no problem with a game being tough but i do have a problem with how often lobcorp sets up undoing progress as a means to punish failure. there's nothing quite as soul-suckingly frustrating as completing a day only for a single high-tier abnormality to breach and either wipe out half your facility trying to contain it or force you to sacrifice a huge chunk of your upgrade points in order to suppress it. a single mistake is often all it takes to either instantly end your day with a restart which can be very disheartening when days last thirty minutes or more and this problem is exacerbated when trying to learn how the abnormalities work. while the game is built with restarting from day one in mind (as you keep your e.g.o. and abnormality logs and can thus avoid ones you don't want for your current facility) it is no less frustrating to go all the way back to day one after putting so much effort into making it further than you did before.  tedious gameplay a grindy design and all over the place difficulty that uses the erasure of progress as a means of punishing failure are the signs of an game that lacks polish. lobcorp is truly jank but underneath that jank is an experience that is fascinating and engaging. learning about abnormalities and then mastering their containment always feels great while learning about the world and the story of the facility and the damned souls who run it make for a story that is nothing short of enthralling. i haven't even spoken about how the game integrates story elements into the gameplay which are so absolutely genius that i cannot even speak about them here for fear of ruining their impact in-game.   i've chosen to be very upfront with lobcorp's problems in this review because i feel that anyone who wants to get into this game should know about them but i think it speaks volumes for how compelling the good elements of lobcorp are that i've sunken more than fourty hours into the damn thing despite my eminent bitching. even with all it does wrong you can just tell that this game was the work of a team that really wanted to make something [i]interesting[/i] despite their lack of game design skill which shines through in the compelling elements it succeeds in. i will commit to beating lobcorp in spite of it's flaws because being the manager of this fucked up little slice of hell is too compelling to put down unfinished.",2021-07-20,2021-07-22,True,10,0,0.634062409400939941,0,True,False,False

 tl;dr: very mechanically dense game due to sheer variety of variables a game where perfect runs are very difficult a very difficult game in general some employee management and very light rts elements mostly in micro/macro being helpful terms to describe how you maneuver your employees. don't buy this game for the rts elements i stress it's mostly a terminology thing. 50 days gets brutally difficult near the end you will have to soft reset the game using an in game mechanic for the plot if you don't like playing similar content repeatedly i'd skip this one you'll be doing a lot of it. i enjoyed the plot it worked for what it was trying to do though it kicks in too late for it to be something i'd suggest as a primarily purchase decision.  if you want a sort've rough around the edges resource management game you could do much worse and you'll get a nice plot and some good monster design to go with it.",2021-07-07,2021-07-07,True,8,0,0.601347923278808594,0,True,False,False

[spoiler]fuck of yesod i'm trying my best here![/spoiler]  a nice feature of this game is that every level you do counts as a day and every few days you get a checkpoint if you progress a few days and really realize you are in a bad place with abnormalities you picked or how you built your employees you can rewind back to the last checkpoint (you can also retry your current day as well). the research you did on abnormalities will remain and you have any employee who died after the checkpoint return and lose any you added. there are missions in this and when you complete a mission and rewind the mission is still completed. do not be afraid to do this it's quite handy at least for me. also try to do your missions as soon as you can because completing a mission provides you with a nice upgrade that you can choose.  okay this part is going to be entirely in spoiler tags because i am going to tell you about two abnormalities i would not recommend picking. one because it is something that you need to be later in game to handle and the other which is just tedious and i reset when i realized how it worked. here's the one that i got way too early in game: [spoiler]there is an abnormality called magical girl or queen of hatred she can actually be pretty helpful but if three employees or clerks (ai controlled employees) don't die within a certain amount of time she goes on a rampage and can decimate your entire facility. eventually you can get an item called execution bullets so i would recommend avoiding getting her till then. her teaser line is in the name of love and justice~ here comes magical girl! so if you see that don't grab it till you're ready.[/spoiler] here's the other that is just tedious imo. [spoiler]it's called express train to hell and is actually a tool type abnormality that when used can heal or buff your agents. the thing is every two minutes or so if you don't interact with it a train will run through your facility slaughtering everything in its path. it's easy to get focused on something else in the facility and only realize you forgot about the train until it's too late. happened to me until i reset to a previous checkpoint. the teaser line for this one is when the time comes the train will chug down the tracks and sound its mighty horn.[/spoiler]  ",2021-02-26,2021-02-26,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(the reset here is different from what you may understand but digger deeper will spoil the game so take your own risk.) this can be converted to at least 100 hrs (very bare minimum) real playtime. so only jump into it if you want to invest such long time here.  2. you'll need to do research you know nothing about the abnormalities and the lc universe itself. when you start the game a whole new world is open to you and this could quickly overwhelm you and worsen your game experience if you insist on trial-and-error. first piece of advice is to take your time and read carefully the manual the game throws at you at the start. you will refer to it constantly during the first few days anyway. second piece of advice is to do research on wiki and guides and such for the immediately upcoming abnormalities and challenges while trying not to spoil yourself further. trust me. doing research for this game won't ruin your game experience by making the game much easier. you will still fail a lot due to your carelessness and such.  3. you need strong skills of control and management into the late game the game will put you through mountains of challenges sometimes to the point that you will feel unfair. if you want to challenge your limit of concentration and management skills this game is perfect. otherwise take your chance. (of course you can choose to bypass some of the challenges but you'll get bad endings which i consider not game completion.)  4. you're up for a brain exercise. let me try to talk about this without spoilers. as i said you don't know anything about the abnormalities and lc universe at the start and those sometimes depends on the things that the characters tell you. talking to the characters is like playing a guessing game since they can constantly confuse you in the early game (since you don't know anything) and further confuse you philosophically in the late game (since they think you can dig deeper into the universe by then). even its appearance does not tell you i assure you the story element in this game is heavy. very heavy. just a teaser every abnormality has its own backstory and there are eighty-sth abnormalities.  5. bugs and dev support this is not a new game. there are still bugs and optimization issues that remain unsolved to this date but i don't think the dev will solve them anymore. (for example the game sometimes shuts itself down if you play for too long. this once made me so mad since i just finished doing a difficult task and the game didn't save before crashing.) luckily there're some mods that can solve those problems and you can easily find these mods from internet. nonetheless don't expect dev support since they may just only focus on lor (the sequel to lc) by now.   6. one thing that i hold a grudge as i said the game encourages you to reset. in fact it is still technically possible if you want to finish the game without bad endings in one go (without resets). however to do that you have to avoid doing a specific thing (i won't spoil it here) that the game never even tries to hint at. so if you didn't spoil yourself about a specific thing about the endgame you will probably get to a point where you soft-lock your game progress and have no way but to reset. personally i feel that's a bad and unfair game design since it potentially gives you the freedom to finish the game in one go but screws it up afterwards (unintentionally?). i used multiple mods and commands to cheese that but that's still frustrating.  7. after all these... still a positive review after all the technical problems i still give a positive review because i believe the dev has put a lot of effort into this game. the stories of the abnormalities and the universe are rich and amazing. the challenges though beyond tough are well-thought and make you feel rewarding if you actually complete them. i can't ignore the effort and creativity here. to me this is a game with excellent insight and idea yet may be technically unsatisfying if you're unlucky or unprepared.  i'm writing this review two weeks after 100% completing the game so maybe i miss sth that i will add to this review in the future. but for now i hope my review helps some newcomers who're considering buying this game.

well if you're familiar with scp- and yes i know some people frown upon comparing the two but it's easiest to explain with a comparison such as this- you'll know that each of these abnormalities will have their own set of needs that they need to have met in order to produce energy. if said needs aren't met they could bring harm to the employee that's currently assigned to harvest energy from them or potentially much much worse things.   this game unlike some people may want to believe is a roguelike. you are going to fail a lot and when that happens you usually restart the day and try again with the knowledge from your previous attempt. however should you find yourself with an abnormality that you simply cannot handle or maybe a handful of different abnormalities that paired together leave you in an extremely difficult situation like for example one that despises being looked at next to another that demands you to look at it the game gives you several options to fix this issue. for example every day that ends with the number 1 or 6 will be a hard-save state which you can return to from any other day. if you do this you'll keep all of the gear and information that you acquired on the days ahead of time but all progress made levelling up and training your employees will be lost. so if you got an abnormality that was way too much to handle but still managed to get some information or maybe even gear about it you'll keep all of that information if you are to ever choose that abnormality again as well as keep any of the gear that you may have harvested from it. of course replacing that gear if lost is an entirely different story.  and if for some reason that isn't enough.. restarting from the very first day of the game is completely okay and honestly intended. i had to do this three or four times before beating the game entirely and that's okay. just like with the save-states i mentioned you'll keep all of the gear and information you learned about the monsters. if you happened to get the basic information of one of them their name will even replace the serial code they get when they show up as an option for a new monster when the day starts allowing you to choose between a familiar face or a new scary but potentially valuable new abnormality.   there's many different levels of abnormality and generally the more dangerous it is the more powerful it's obtainable gear will be and the more energy it will prudce. while having a safe facility can be nice it'll also make your days take much longer. and as the game progresses it will start to punish you for taking too long in each day through a mechanic called ordeals. you'll learn more about them by playing yourself but all i will say is that generally.. once you reach a midnight ordeal it's considered a game-over unless you're already prepared for what's to come.  completing missions and progressing days will reward you with progressing the story. missions will continue a character's individual story while ending a day will progress the overall plot. you need to do both of these to get to the finale but doing so isn't really that difficult. while individual missions are difficult at certain points (looking at you disciplinary team..) but every mission you complete and the upgrade you'll get from it will be permanent even if you restart the game from day 1. so you have as long as you need to get all of the missions done.  take your time with this game. it's okay to try over and over again and sometimes this will be the case. this game isn't for everyone and quite frankly there's a bit of jank with the ui in some situations and it becomes apparent after awhile. but it's all worth it in my opinion because of the absolute gem of a story that's hidden behind this game. everything in the game and i mean *everything* is a part of the story. every game mechanic every seemingly one-off dialogue line the filler it's all building upon a beautiful story that you simply don't expect from a game like this at least not from the first impressions. if you're willing to put up with the many many hours you'll spend retrying (it took me roughly 90 to 100 hours to clear the game for the first time) i think this game is more than worth the time investment. i won't go any deeper into any of the characters or story because i think those are best experienced for yourself.  also the game is particularly good at making you attached to your employees so if you're someone who likes writing original characters.. well this game will give you lot of ammunition for getting attached to your random little employee mason and you may just find it that the game wrote a character arc for him purely through it's gameplay. but if that's not your kind of thing then this point is pretty null.",2021-02-16,2022-07-25,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[b]gameplay:[/b]  simply put: abnormalities are dangerous but profitable. the more of a threat they pose the more energy they‚Äôll generate in interactions. your job is to dictate who handles which abnormality and how they do it. the trouble is you get these things in black boxes with nothing more than a brief sentence to suggest what it could be. while the text might motivate your choice of which one you get it won‚Äôt tell you how to handle it safely or even give you an accurate depiction of how dangerous it is. figuring that out is a matter of trial and error on your part. in other words send someone in there and see if you can learn anything valuable from it. there are fair odds that they‚Äôll die in the process. most abnormalities can be lethal if you don‚Äôt understand them and that‚Äôs the crux of it all. information is your greatest asset. your job at its core is to find and apply it.  while lobotomy corp. is an rts in the sense that stuff happens in real time you‚Äôve got a pause button and two fast forward settings. what this amounts to is that you need to pay attention to where people need to be and when they need to be there. the time for fast decision making will come when you‚Äôre more prepared for it. as you accumulate more abnormalities the time settings help you to increase the scale of your orders without slowing the game down. even if all hell breaks loose you can always rewind to the start of the day or to the most recent checkpoint. if you make a mistake you can always try again.  while the game eases you in real nicely don‚Äôt expect to see it through from start to finish in your first run. there will come a point where there are too many things that can go wrong and progress will become infeasible. while it‚Äôs important to understand where to accept mistakes and push forward it‚Äôs equally critical to know when to go back and take it from the top. each run is easier than the last though the final days will always be a trial.  overall the gameplay is built upon a simple system of interaction that introduces different rules for each abnormality. the game is paced in such a way that the player will always be handling something new and will eventually be overwhelmed by the later game stages. upon reaching these stages the player is meant to restart with what resources they have and make it further the next time. the core of the game is solid and there‚Äôs easily enough content to fill multiple playthroughs with unique encounters.  aside from all that i really enjoyed the character customization in the game. while you are the manager known as ‚Äúx‚Äù you‚Äôve got full control over who gets hired. in other words you get to customize your employees to look like cartoonish versions of your friends among other things. it‚Äôs the best kind of character customizer in my eyes mainly in that it doesn‚Äôt influence the story. especially because it doesn‚Äôt. your characters are free to develop their own stories and traits without compromising the world they exist in. that‚Äôs the magic of it.  [b]writing:[/b]  the story of this game is generally presented in the visual novel format at the end of each day. while i can‚Äôt say too much about it without spoiling anything the story focuses on giving many trails for the player to follow. as mentioned earlier you won‚Äôt see everything on your first attempt but you‚Äôll certainly tug on different threads with each playthrough. the story is well thought out as the events all work in their own ways to paint a picture of the world its people and their dreams.  the character writing certainly holds its own too. everyone‚Äôs lived a time in the world and has come to work in the facility in one way or another ‚Äúx‚Äù included. the present is founded upon the past and it shows in every interaction you see. everyone‚Äôs haunted by a shadow of sorts and it hides in their words and actions. beyond them every abnormality has a story behind it too some of which relating mechanically to others with similar backstories.  what really made this special in my eyes was the story‚Äôs willingness to get into grey and even dark areas. the road to hell was paved with good intentions and we‚Äôre beyond the point of asking if the ends could ever justify the means. what counts is seeing it through to the end.  [b]conclusion:[/b]  lobotomy corporation is a long game that has a lot of unique systems and is positively bursting with creativity in its story and designs. if you‚Äôve got time to burn all the better. this is a good one for sure. at the very least i can recommend it.",2021-01-03,2021-01-03,True,7,0,0.624849617481231689,0,True,False,False

[spoiler]for example you literally cannot win against malkuth - girl with a notepad without having a physical notepad yourself. mind == blown. [/spoiler] they managed to surprise me every time right to the last day.  and the plot did so even a bit after the last day.   speaking of plot the game manages expectations very very well. expectations getting flipped upside down is the most satisfying part. can't talk about it without getting into spoilers though. i warned you:  you might think that the game is about monsters and that it's the part we have to uncover.  [spoiler]but it's actually everything else. the story the characters the city above and it's troubles.[/spoiler]  you probably think that abnormalities are some alien creatures that ended up here somehow and we need to contain them.  [spoiler]they're actually more human than anybody in your facility. and we are making them to exploit them later![/spoiler]  [spoiler]you probably think that angela is plotting something against you or the corporation after playing a few days  it's much more complicated than that. i don't know what to tell you. play the game.[/spoiler]  after playing for some time you will start to think that restarting the day and the memory repository is an awkward implementation of a save game feature.  [spoiler]you couldn't be more wrong. it's actually an essential part of both the gameplay and the story by design. it brings another layer to the gameplay and explains a lot story wise when you find it out.[/spoiler]  you might think you're a manager clueless and fresh to the company and you should do what sephirot and angela tell you like what malkuth instructs you to do on day 1.  [spoiler]you're actually a the founder of the company. and the sephirot including angela are here against against their will just because you willed it. and they're waiting expectantly for you to pull them out of their misery and lead them somewhere. [/spoiler]  [spoiler]the facility literally turns upside down on day 50. it actually looks like a tree that way. then it sprouts from the surface and emits light.  it just all makes sense in the end - the tree of light the seed the goddamn cactus on a desk eventually bearing a flower. and it's only one example of many.[/spoiler]  buy and play lobotomy corporation. and i'm not giving you a fucking choice.",2020-06-25,2023-09-14,True,1,1,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

(i'll note i don't entirely approve of the translation cleanup as some of the engrish actually helped accentuate how strange and esoteric the game is).  the music is superb though you'll be hearing two or three tracks far more often than the others; the inclusion of a diegetic music system rating you based on current panic level really does help you keep solid tabs of how well you're keeping the facility under tabs -- and conversely how boned you really are when things truly hit the fan.   of special note is the [i]second trumpet[/i] theme. you'll know it when it happens - and you'll learn to love/hate the level of chaos that provokes it.  being a roguelike game built on a 'days' system lobocorp does a lot to try and balance the level of stress it ekes out of the player with some nice quality of life features both built-in and unlockable. it is mechanically rich and thematically saturated with subtle and not-so-subtle hints to hebrew scripture and kabbalah teachings alongside its varied references to exterior sources.  [h1]a few tips for the prospective player![/h1] the wiki exists but please refrain from using it until necessary. this game thrives on uncertainty and study. never be afraid to fail as you learn more from failure than success. never be afraid to restart; unlockables stay unlocked through playthroughs even equipment (until death!) if it sounds bad it's probably bad. if it sounds good it's [b]definitely[/b] bad. do look over the provided manual and attempt to parse the four-color-coded stats system as the terminology used is a little intentionally esoteric. red is physical stats white is mental stats purple is workspeed and success and blue/pale governs speed. trust the manual. but don't trust it too much.  spread the love with equipment and avoid the urge to overspecialize departments.   among the many things the lobocorp offers you'll get to :  [list]   [*]hang out with the skull!   [*]read the provided manual!   [*]learn the manual is kind of useless!   [*]kill your first employee (complete with champagne)!   [*]don't touch the button!   [*]learn the color-coded danger levels!   [*]learn the color-coded danger levels are meaningless!   [*]give someone the notepad!   [*]don't blink!   [*]experience new and fascinating forms of anxiety!   [*]hang out with grandma until she gives you the thing you want!   [*]neglect grandma after that!   [*]hang out with the skull!   [*]appreciate the fine arts!   [*]suffer for your art!   [*]make [i]others[/i] suffer for your art!   [*]don't touch the button!   [*]play with strange devices!   [*]play with strange creatures!

do you enjoy learning from failure and dealing with what can become hectic yet exciting gameplay? then lobotomy corporation should peak your interest.  you are the new manager of lobotomy corporation and you are responsible for utilizing various abnormalities of ranging levels of danger and complication in a newfound attempt to generate energy for a society whose energy needs have skyrocketed compared to what we know today. all the while you learn slowly about the history and origins of the company along with the features gimmicks and dangers of the abnormalities that you slowly add to the facility one-to-two at a time.  you also have to deal with the sephirahs who are basically your assistant managers of each respective department in the facility. command team training team security team information team et cetera. they each have their own personalities and stories which you learn by completing their challenges that range from easy peezy to go fuck yourself! you want me to do what!?  the game is challenging. you will retry things and the game encourages this. the game plays day-by-day and restarting from the beginning of the current day is free (sans resetting the progress you made). that means that while you will still have to unlock the details and entries for new abnormalities again (which you'll want to do as they provide bonuses and allow you to unlock an abnormalities' unique equipment) you will restart a day with the internal knowledge of the new abnormalities weaknesses what they hate how they like their tea and so on. this means that you won't accidentally kill your first worker who you send there by picking the wrong thing and giving them oolong tea when they absolutely fucking demand black tea or so help me i will burn your children!  on top of this the game has two soft-reset functions. first is the hard way; you can reset from day 1. in doing so you keep all entries you've gained and all equipment you've unlocked. however you lose all of your characters and their levels (who you can re-hire if you're attached) and you start from scratch in choosing the abnormalities to add each day. depending on if you got some abnormalities that aren't exactly chill with each other (red hooded nerd and the maybe big bad somehow doggo for example) this may be a blessing but if you've gotten a good set of easy-to-handle abnormalities then this may not be a good idea.  so then you choose the second soft-reset; you just got a really bad abnormality that ruins the nice balance you just got and you've already gotten all of its information? well every few in-game days you get a memory imprint which allows you to reset to that day instead of going all the way back to day 1. the same things apply; you keep info and equipment. you also lose any employees hired in the time between the current day and the imprint day. but you can fix mild issues or prolong a run to get more info on new abnormalities.  combat in the game can actually be quite intricate and interesting. the game is set on multiple floors with elevators to quickly traverse up and down. many abilities (both yours and abnormalities) can effect entire departments entire floors or an entire row or column of the facility. direction you enter a combat scenario from can be the difference between death and victory. you have to think and learn and it's actually sometimes a good idea to let abnormalities run rampant so you learn how to avoid them doing that the next time. it's ingenious in its simplicity.  music is fantastic and varied and tells the mood very well. the art style is cute but easy to read. i absolutely recommend the soundtrack.  in conclusion i absolutely recommend lobotomy corporation but with the following caveat: at the time of this review the english translation is dodgy. this stems from circumstances out of the developer's control (basically they got screwed over by the company who was supposed to be responsible for the english translation) but nonetheless the game does have translation issues which in rare circumstances can actually lead to telling players things that are objectively false when it comes to gameplay.  for example characters in game can have stats leveled 1 - 5. something might say characters with at least 3 of x will be killed while actually meaning more than x so a 1-stat difference that you thought was safe kills one of your better employees and forces you to retry for a reason that isn't because of your own negligence but rather because of exactly the opposite. this is rare but it sucks. just keep it in mind. if you are frustrated with an abnormality use the wiki and find out how to deal with it. there's no harm in it. some of them are frustrating to learn for a lot of people even though it does give you an idea of how to solve it (i'm looking at you schadenfreude!)  if you want to watch some gameplay and hilarity i have 17+ videos of the game on my channel at this time (mostly sh**posts). https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plr4eb3p42g8f0ll4thrsdej9umaggrfmc check it out or don't.",2020-03-14,2020-10-21,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False

(sorry for ranting so long in this review i'll shut up now-)  over all i love this game for what it is and i would 100% recommend it! it's a amazing game that deserves more love. so to any one out there reading this review go play this game! all the things i didn't like about the game are just little things i noticed and don't break the game. in fact if you like challenge then play this game! it's one of the greatest games of all time! project moon keep doing your best! and i can't wait to see what your next game has to offer!",2020-01-04,2020-01-04,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[/spoiler]  2) the translation is rough. the gist of it is there and sometimes there's some clever plays on words but the translator is obviously not a native english speaker. it's better than google translate but be prepared for odd phrasing and typos. for the most part i had no problems but the more surreal the plot and the more metaphysical the topic of discussion the harder the script is to parse.  3) it's long mostly as a result of the difficulty. i got through it by pecking at it slowly over a long period of time but if you want to just play the game and move on to the next one in your library i can't recommend it.  but if those caveats don't deter you and you stick through to the end the emotional payoff is worth it. it's just not a game for everyone.  edit 9/16/2020: the english translation has been entirely reworked since i posted this review originally and is much much better. it is no longer an issue with the game.",2019-12-16,2021-11-28,True,6,0,0.595877766609191895,0,True,False,False

[h1] gameplay [/h1] lobotomy inc is a relatively peaceful management sim early in the game but as the steps grow longer and more and more difficult anomalies enter the fray you'll find yourself bouncing several of your hired employees to reach the daily energy quota while doing enough research to prevent the facility and/or the world from ending from said anomalies. all in a good days work.  really playing the game is it's own tutorial. with the help and successes of your research on anomalies you'll uncover management tidbits as well as devise your own strategies specialize or bolster your workers/agents/employees to handle said anomalies. the hardest part is beginning said research. because you know next to nothing when you first get a new anomaly. and it's satisfyingly nerve racking. did i mention that everytime you get a new anomaly you pick one from a selection of three (and all you know to differentiate them is a vague quote about them). yup satisfyingly chilly and atmospheric af too. very cool mechanic. especially for your first few campaigns.  when you first get an anomaly you'll know next to nothing about it and it's up to your guessing skills and agents you've built up to start the research and then energy gaining process. the game is quite forgiving in this state as anomalies that are triggered from one bad move tend to not be wholly catastrophic. and you can sort of guess what a blood powered bath tub can and can't do. sort of.  the tension is still there however and as the game goes on you're given so many options such as the use of anomalies and special forces to help manage the facility and/or accidents. really the best times happen when you accidentally forgot to check on an anomaly that sends a interdimensional train ramming all your agents in the facility. it's thus very very helpful that you're given a reset button in the escape menu if things go too wrong. and things will most certainly go wrong. and you will be amazed just how bad it can get. and you'll panic and try to fix it all before finally relenting that you should probably have pressed that reset button 20 minutes ago. but if you fix it all then you'll feel like you just saved the entire world (which you probably did).   there are two phases to each game day. you keep the ego (special equipment earned from doing detailed research on anomalies) and codex entries on the anomalies that you've done on your playthroughs. allowing for a sense of accomplishment and progress. those ego equipment is pretty important in the prep phase before a day as you'll definitely want to create both specialists and generalists among your agents as more and more dangerous anomalies present themselves. who knows? you might come across an anomaly that may actually help you ... provided you know what you're doing. it's a viable strat to leave a certain anomaly alone if you feel incapable of managing it (that said some anomalies literally have a time clock to doom so be careful).  as the game progressed you'll unlock more and more tools to directly influence as well as upgrade the various departments as the facility grows and expands. use these to your upmost advantage (or survival). subtle maneuvers such as moving your agents/employees to different rooms in preperation to a breach can really make a difference. they also help with ordeals which are random progressively more difficult events that occur the longer you work on each anomaly during a single day. prepare to accept losses.  overall if not for the lacklustre translation on a few anomalies and their unlockable management entries the gameplay is a very solid [b]9/10[/b]. a very hands on approach to a management sim with a surprising level of tension surprise and sometimes sheer panic and horror. best leave that multi appendaged abomination for another day aye.  however a key [b]flaw[/b] is the downtime when a mistake doesn't happen. this is inadevertently the majority of the early game which can be quite laborious and boring due to it's generally weaker threat level. thankfully the story makes passing this stage quite bearable to the mid game where the game really opens out and gives you a lot of options as well as challenges to upgrade your various departments.   [h1]story[/h1] contrary to a lot of management sims these days. lobotomy has a fairly long and immersive campaign that functions similar to a traditional visual novel style game. the campaign lasts for a very good few months with a good play session of 2 or so hours summing up to 1-3 days. that is a lot of story and gameplay to unpack for a game that's $20 usd. i won't spoil the story but if you guys like something to top off your [strike]scps[/strike] anomalies lobotomy does not disappoint. evidently i'm not good at rating stories but it's above average so hmmm [b] 8.5/10[/b] sounds good. did i mention taht every anomaly has it's own background story too (unfortunately also suffering from some translation flaws)  [h1]music and art [/h1] each anomaly has it's own bells and chimes that you can hear when zoomed in on their appropriate holding cells. some range from barely audible to very audible [insertlovecraftianhorrortrackhere]. they definitely work the treat to provide that uncanny experience as you manage them. these are further bolstered by short dialogue clips that show up while working with the anomalies that aren't written down in the in-game codex/encyclopedia. subtle features like this makes the game all the better. offcourse there is just general facility music and [b] danger [/b] music. i won't spoil that last one cuz it's a whole different treat when you've reached each of the three stages of 'you fucked up'.   each anomaly main characters and agents you control are wonderfully cartoonish and juxtapose the whole paranormal stuff that goes on in the facility. this quickly dissolves as things go awry however and your once amicable and harmless looking employees can quick devolve into panic fueled messes as trumpets roar your first danger step. it has a slight but signficant urge of dread and subtle realism that sinks in these moments.  a straight [b]10/10[/b] for how much i enjoyed it all.   [h1] overall [/h1] apart from some bugs with a very specific anomaly i'd say lobotomy corp is quite the underrated marvel of a game. if you're looking for some added spice to your management sims and can handle some xcom levels of difficulty/rng lobotomy is a perfect time sink. oh offcourse give it a go if you love the scp foundation as well.   [b]9/10[/b] held back by translation flaws but a very good and one of a kind game. worth full price if you're willing to steel yourself and wiki some of the anomalies when you have trouble. will suffer from my mistakes again (and again). also made by a korean team btw.",2019-10-29,2019-12-15,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

[b] the good: [/b] the experience of working with strange creatures and slowly discovering how to use them and work around them feels wonderfully evocative of scp foundation-like stories; this is a game you really really want to go into unspoiled.   the character designs are nice the music despite mostly being not made for the game is incredibly well chosen and most of all; the story and setting designs have so much thought clearly put into them that it feels like an incredibly well plotted out dystopian setting a fact that i'm sure the seuqel library of ruina will only flesh out more when it's released.  [b] the bad: [/b] the gameplay while fun at first can become repetitive later; especially when you're managing several abnormalities you're used to and going through days that can take upwards of 15 minutes at times and especially if you're restarting a day repeatedly for a specific option or trying to deal with a specific boss battle. it can get grindy so be prepared for that. it's also quite difficult at points and will often require you to rewind and try things again if you fucked up too many times or didn't do well enough. if you give up easily this game probably isn't for you!  [b] the elephant in the room: [/b] a notable fact and a fact that will likely be remedied soon is that for several years this game has had an infamously bad translation as a result of the dev team being essentially scammed. however a retranslation by a dedicated fan group that'll be added officially to the game is in the works to fix this. despite that for the best experience i'd personally recommend waiting until the translation is complete to play the game - the lore in this thing is t h i c c and you'd be really cheating yourself by experiencing it through an indecipherable and confusing lens.   overall if you like intricate stories management simulators and watching everything go to hell as you try to protect your precious agents from entities that have no right to exist buy lobotomy corporation. it's not for everyone and it has its flaws but it's one of my favorite games of all time off pure story alone. despite that i'm only giving it a 8/10 due to the aforementioned details.",2019-10-14,2019-10-14,True,55,1,0.799283921718597412,0,True,False,False

(it's a joke chill.)  lobotomy corp is a management game in which you hold and research scp's. each attention or the lack there of in very specific ways in order to keep them under control. as more and more are added to your management every day your skills are pushed further and further. as more demands grow as well as the possibility of those demands overlapping with other scp's in conflicting ways. learning how to manage each one effectively to reduce possible risks.  learning and managing how these things work is a strange and engaging experience each scp being a puzzle to be mentally constructed as you observe behaviour. making sure you research it in the correct way and observe every little action it does in response. i've had an insane amount of fun just trying to work out why and what causes them to behave the way they do.  at the same time the game is held back by a number of extremely frustrating issues. the ui is outright awful confusing unresponsive at times and can often get your staff killed. as you try to micromanage specific abilities of scp's but finding the ui failing to do what you want it to do such as trying to move staff away from the doom approaching from the other side of the hallway. an alert system that warns you but fails to tell you anything else in which every so often you need to manually scan every room in the base instead of just listing affected rooms. missing a single one can lead to a game over as even a single death requires the day to be restarted.  the tutorial and translation are pretty bad. i'd outright suggest just going to the games wikipedia game and reading up on the mechanics than trying to understand the tutorial.  this is my biggest issue with the game deaths. at the end of every day you're given points to increase staff attributes or to hire new staff and increase their attributes. unfortunately if a staff members dies the number of points given is drastically reduced. so not only did you lose someone very well trained but you also lose points needed to replace them. a single loss requires you to restart the day or you just end up in a downwards spiral of losing staff but no points to replace them! please redesign this!  my last issue while most scp's are strange but fun to explore some can be utterly rage inducing. often requiring you to go back multiple days to simply make sure you never pick them again! spoilers incoming but it's to give you an idea of the biggest offenders. [spoiler] 1) a scarecrow that requires intelligence research to not break free but breaks free if someone too intelligent does the research. often the staff member assigned for this will level up their intelligence by working on it. so you need a new staff member for that spc every day! 2) an scp that can wipe most the base if not clicked on every 2min 3) worst of all... an scp that will kill the entire base if you take your camera off of it. holy damn whyyy?! if you get this guy all your hours need to make sure this asshole is always on screen. why?! it's awful![/spoiler]  while i have many complaints lobotomy corporation is a diamond in the rough. it's many issues while frustrating are pushed aside by how unique and interesting the gameplay is. i know i complained a lot but that's because i absolutely adore this game! it's just so rough around the edges. if you're into scp stuff at all pick this game up and even if you're not it's a great management game on its own.",2019-08-17,2019-08-17,True,13,2,0.572668313980102539,0,False,False,False

game draws heavily from the scp foundation. so much so that they even straight up admit this on the steam store page i feel like the lack luster tutorial forcing me to throw my none the wiser employees at potentially dangerous abnormalities to even begin figuring out what i was doing added significantly to the experience. after i got over the initial learning curve i was glad they did things the way they did. 	so what did i learn? the game is broken up into days. over the course of each day you are tasked with collecting an ever increasing amount of enkephalin that will be packaged into pe boxes and used to create energy to meet the ever growing needs of humanity! you do this by taking care of the abnormalities. you have 4 options to use in this endeavor. instinct which applies to the base physiological needs. insight aimed at improving their cell. attachment to satisfy their social needs. and lastly repression to suppress the existential entity and it‚Äôs spiritual desires. while those descriptions sound intense and varied on the surface it basically boiled down to finding out which one a specific abnormality prefered and more or less spamming it. at least at first... you could deduce this through trial and error or increase your observation level of the abnormality. as you work with the creatures and gain pe boxes you would accrue another resource creatively named unique pe boxes. you could then spend these to learn about that specific entity. such as its name. how it responds to the various interactions. what it‚Äôs attack and defense is like. insight into its unique characteristics and once those were finished you could spend all the leftover on unique equipment to gear up your employees. my favorite was a magic gun from an old lady that could shoot insane workers back to peak mental health. which leads me to your employees. 	in between days you would earn lob points. these would be spent on hiring customizing and raising the stats of your workforce. outside of spending your lob points to do so your workers could also improve their stats overtime by performing work on the abnormalities and once enough stats were gained they‚Äôd also receive a promotion. i didn‚Äôt really notice their promotion level having any impact outside of being a representation of an individual‚Äôs overall abilities. there were 4 stats one for each of the four interactions that we talked about before but beyond improving their proficiency in a specific interaction they also improved the various aspects of that individual. fortitude was for instinct work and would increase their maximum health pool. prudence was for insight work and would increase their maximum sanity. temperance was linked to attachment work and increased the overall work speed and success rate and lastly justice was tied to repression work and their movement speed. 	in between days each employee could be assigned and freely reassigned to various departments you would unlock and level up by assigning the 1 new abnormality you would receive to that division. as employees spend days working for a specific department they would gain a permanent bonus like increasing their movement speed from the control department or temperance for working in the information department. the department heads would also give you missions and completing them would reward you with a new perk they called research you could unlock at the end of the day. some of the earliest ones you would get would be the ability to increase the speed to 2x or 3x or the ability to send employees to work on abnormalities in other divisions. 	now as i said earlier. at the start of the game it‚Äôs pretty straightforward to attend to your abnormalities and most of the starting ones that i encountered could be summed up as find the type of work they prefer and spam it. pushing into the end of the control department and beginning of the information department the first and second departments respectively. the abnormalities start to become quite dangerous if the employee doesn‚Äôt perform the work well. then going into the 3rd and 4th departments information and training the scps begin to become incredibly unique.one stood out the most to me was ‚Äúbeauty and the beast‚Äù. beauty and the beast was the first unique abnormality i encountered. it gives the most boxes from repression work but this would lower it‚Äôs invisible health bar. if beauty and the beast died they would also kill the employee then respawn. other works would increase this invisible health bar. so it was part guessing game and part balancing act to acquire energy from beauty and the beast. 	 lobotomy corporation is a rogue lite game. it is an incredibly lite rogue lite though. you are given the ability to revert to the start of the day where you assign and equip employees. you also get a ‚Äúmemory imprint‚Äù every 5 days that you can revert to and then of course in rogue lite fashion you can go all the way back to the start but keep certain things. all observations are carried over. along with any unspent unique pe boxes and all the equipment you still had at the end of your last run. 	now i‚Äôve mentioned equipment a few times without touching on it. ‚Äúwhat does it do?‚Äù you may be wondering. once again it‚Äôs divided into 4 categories. red is for health damage. white is for sanity damage. black is health and sanity damage and lastly pale is a percentage of hp. as of writing this i didn‚Äôt make it far enough to encounter pale damage. the abnormalities and defensive equipment would have strengths and weaknesses to these elements then each abnormality and worker based on their weapon would deal one of these damages. unless it was white damage and they were attacking a co-worker it would fill up their sanity. which was kind of silly to behold but very useful. 	overall i had a ton of fun with this game and expect it to be a regular in my gaming library. i'd say the game was worth full price. even more worth it if it goes on sale.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8mttwm_y8y",2019-07-17,2019-07-18,True,4,0,0.564586341381072998,0,True,False,False

well as you may know asians do prefer a little higher difficulty than europeans and with this said... this game will fuck like no tomorrow on several occasions. there are some upgrades that make things easier for you but they are locked behind missions the ai's give you and some of the later ones are brutal. and this upgrades ‚Äì when we boil it down - just help you to get through the early days faster just so you can tackle the harder challenges in the later game. and the challenges never stop. in the beginning it will be a big success to send someone into a room with an old broken armor without the employee dying while later on you have to fight god and the game-mechanics themselves.  this game knows how to make a situation worse and worse. in one moment everything seems fine and in the next a chain-reaction causes doom. add to that some very poorly optimized game-mechanics in some instances and frustration will arrive fast. often times i wanted to punch the wall give up and screamed at my monitor. i even took several week-long brakes to calm me down. but i always returned and faced the bullshit this game threw at me... and it was worth it. it can be addictive if you are a optimizer or a perfectionist. you always think: i can do better! and so you try again... ...and again... ...and again... ...just for the kick when you finally manage to overcome.  graphics:  if you believe it or not even the cartoonish graphics have an in-game explanation. they are quite charming. the employees look cute and there are a ton of gory death animations for them. the monsters have all a varied design and you always know who is who. some of the still-images from the cut-scenes look extremely gorgeous as well.   story:  while the monsters are the focus in the early game where you learn their often very interesting back-stories (often referring old fairy-tales or legends) there is also a overarching plot. in the middle of all of this are the ai's the past of the corporation and the mysterious founder a. let me tell you that all of the ai are batshit crazy and the more you play the more you learn about them and the dystopian world they live in.  between the days there are dialogues with the ai's in a visual-novel fashion and this how most the plot is told. the main-story will be the driving force in the latter half of the game and depending on your stance you can call it pretentious meh or phenomenal. you can tell that the makers are fans of neon genesis evangelion with its dark intriguing plot and symbols. in the 50 days to the finale you will experience a lot of crazy plot-twits tragic back-stories complicated words and darker themes in a hopeless world. i will admit that i was gripped by the story and one reason i pushed through was because i wanted to see how all of this ends. i even got emotional on a few occasions. the end can be little controversial because it is a little open ended. but there is also a sequel in the making so hey... there may be closure in the future. i also think that it is still a very nice end. so i do recommend this game just for the plot itself. but beware. because the studio is very small they could not hire a good translations team and sometimes the english sentences are a bit... messy.     music:  the music is surprisingly good in this game. i honestly did not expected such a great ost and its a shame that it can be nowhere brought. the different alarm-tunes are the highlights (and you will hear them often) but some of the tracks for the ai's or in the cutscenes are very nice too. in the finale there are also two tracks who stand a little bit out and do come from a different composer named dark fantasy studios... but goddammit they make that last day just so much more memorable.   end:  this game is honestly one of my favorites now. there is nothing really like it.  like i said this is not a tycoon-game.  it will force you to micromanage in sometimes very stressful situations. losing is part of the experience. people will die. insanity is behind every corner. you will pray for just one moment of good luck just for things to get even worse than before. often times there will be walls in front of you and you have no idea how to overcome them.  but in the end... everything will be okey. trust me.  if you like a interesting cryptic story with loads of mind-blowing moment you will like this game. if you like a good challenge this game is for you.  it was a wild ride for me that took me several months... but now it is completed. i have witnessed the ending-scene i worked so hard for... and know i feel empty... like a dear comrade just left. thank you projekt moon for this often frustrating bit still amazing experience.",2018-10-03,2019-01-04,True,53,1,0.779013633728027344,9,True,False,False

[h1]abnormalities[/h1] like its inspirations lobotomy corporation has monsters they call abnormalities. these are your subjects that you research on to provide energy towards your facility. each of these guys comes with a story of some sort and perameters on how to utilize/research it. some can benefit your facility in the sense of advanced weaponry or defense while others can quite literally destroy everything you've built up until that point. it's up to you to figure that out however. if you actually take the time to read the lore it's got a good bunch of it. maybe not as much as scp considering that's full of fanmade ones as well but it's got a lot and interesting ones at that.  [h1]suppression[/h1] here's where the rougue/rpg elements begin. suppression is a feature of the game where when certain perameters are achieved [spoiler]whether it be the abnormality acting on its own accord escaping due to frustration or the wrong type of research applied to it[/spoiler] the abnormality escapes. lobotomy corporation shows no mercy when it comes to this as many will quite literally destroy your entire facility if you're not careful. not to worry though! when you do the correct research towards an abnormality it will allow you to purchase gear for your employees (most of the time). not all gear is equipped to deal with all abnormalities however so you will have to be smart about which ones you buy and who you equip them to. i still haven't mastered this myself and find myself getting overrun often.  [h1]why the price?[/h1] okay so in the early access version things were basically completely different. they had a game structured but it was not what they wanted and it took a lot of funds and time to revamp it into the version you see here today. i think they've come a long way and with how much gameplay you can get out of this it's worth $25.  [h1]comparisons to the early access/complaints[/h1] okay first off let me note that the original user interface was 1000x easier to read and use. [url=https://youtu.be/zlrhdbxe878]you can see glimpses of it in this video provided.[/url] it had 5 different things you could do vs the 4 you can only do now and was soooo much friendlier to the one now which i think was provided to cater more towards the korean fanbase as this [i]is[/i] a korean game by a korean-based company. i also find that while it's useful to have staff that can do everything essentially it was a lot more of a fun difficult when you were given only one or two staff members that could do a task and you had to forcibly manage your staff around this.  the early access version also had a different style of equipping as there was really just three categories: longrange melee and defense weaponry. i much prefer the release's version where they are catered to specific entities adding to the gameplay itself. especially since each individual abnormality can have a different type of attack it adds more to have to cater to specific departments. it also added a layer of difficulty that was otherwise not present in the ea version.  the story. there was really a lack of story in ea as all you did was really talk to an ai on what looked like a text simulation similar to zork. not to say that was a bad thing but it was a little...bland. i'm not sure anthropomorphing the ai and the deparments was the right answer but it was a step in the right direction. it kind of made the action choices they gave you make a little more sense than before however when you were just essentially talking to a terminal.  upgrades!!! holy smokes a lot of the features that are given as upgrades were a given in ea but now you have to earn the right not to sit there aimlessly for a few minutes while you wait for your first few abnormalities to act up. i was so upset when they came out with the release and the fact they revamped it to make you [i]earn[/i] these features that are normally given to you. but that's just the spoiled part of me speaking. it's definitely unique.   [h1]overall[/h1] just a generally good game. lots of replay value (especially since it's built in that way) and makes you earn its affection like a nice ale or a woman.",2018-07-24,2018-07-24,True,2,0,0.552238762378692627,0,True,False,False

 after completing certain challenging encounters (i was /not/ expecting this game to essentially have boss fights!) you unlock helpful lasting advantages and one of the first makes the new agents you recruit come in at a much more experienced level which makes replacing even a veteran agent much much easier. so even if you're like me and are super tempted to reset when an agent (or soldier in x-com) dies there are things in the game to help that temptation relax.  it's not all good of course. there are some ui things i really wish the game had like an always visible list of agents with their hp/sp shown which would really help make sure no one's taking way more damage than i expected during an anomaly breach or a lab-wide 'ordeal' encounter. a list of each department's agents pops up when you select a thing they can interact with but it'd be really helpful to see that list all the time. that's probably my biggest complaint. the later days can take a long time but that's because /i/ take my time and feel compelled to squeeze as much leveling up as i possibly can in often specific stats on specific agents into each day as possible. ordering agents around during dangerous situations is not super precise which could be frustrating but is also something i've been able to work around.  i'm having a lot of fun with this game especially the ongoing discovery aspects and would recommend it if you are interested in the above and in a uniquely flavored management sim with plenty of capacity for micromanagement (and the ability to pause at any time with a tap of the spacebar to keep things from ever being overwhelming!). just know that if you play like me the game can be very time consuming.",2018-04-20,2018-04-20,True,11,2,0.6472206711769104,0,True,False,False

(usually instant death) no one wants to die a lot just because there wasn't a built in timer ui in the game to tell you time is almost up.  3. instant death mechanics. usually this comes hand in hand with rng. you get bad rng. a lot of people end up dying. and you get frustrated. because its not because of failure of leadership. its because you rolled the dice and lost. one of the monsters will teleport and blast damage around it on impact. fine. i'll make sure they can survive one teleport. however it will teleport twice onto the same location therfor instant killing them. diminishing returns on effects would reduce the severity of bad rng. (two of the melt down missions adds rng on top of rng quadrupaling the frustration)  4. some things are too situational or useless in general. one tool kills your employees. but the energy output is kinda worthless for the trade off. some monsters exist only to annoy you. *cough meat lantern* one of the later abilities you get is a defense task force. it locks down the entire department. however most monsters in the late game will simply  teleport  into another department. making this ability very very very niche and almost pointless most of the time. the list goes on. so a lot of these pointless things will have to be rebalanced to give them a purpose later.   5. combat is kinda. well its clunky. your employees aren't intelligent enough to make real time decisions. so you have to tell them what to do. frankly its kinda akward to make them  dodge  a couple of macro buttons built into the ui should remedy this. example one. a monster that wrecks everything in melee range. so you want to send ranged attackers to deal with it. so you end up having to akwardly round them all up into one small room and then send them. i don't know what direction the developer is going with this game. cause you're a manager not a commander.  6. couple more user interface options would be nice. here's a few things they can add. (manager creates advanced ai. can't even develop a simple ui that could save employees?) a red box showing what abnormalities are breaching. a tab to show which employees are suppressing which or working with what monster. when you sending employees to suppress a monster it'd be nice if it would reccomend an employee with the appropriate armor or weapon to send. usually you end up having to remember exactly which employee is and what gear they have before you send them. maybe an indicator tab telling you who is about to die? put in a button to press to tell near death employees to run?  7. few extra things that'd be nice. being able to purchase armor or weapons at the beginning of the day. not the occuring day. sometimes you'll forget to purchase the ego gear before the day ends. which can really set you back. some of the clerks are kinda dumb.. slightly smarter self preservation ai would be nice. some hotkeys? so far mostly everything is controlled via mouse. (imagine playing starcraft with only your mouse.. i know right? what are we cave men?)  so is it worth playing or buying even? yeah but the game is so unpolished that newcomers that start playing literally will put it down from all the frustration and annoying things adding up. its still in early access so there's still hope yet. if the finished product as a nice ui reduce the severity of rng rebalance a few things to make them useful and most of the annoying traits are gone then you got yourself a pretty nice game.",2018-03-10,2018-03-10,True,9,1,0.607912838459014893,0,True,False,True

[h1]welcome to lobotomy corporation administrator[/h1]  lobotomy corp is best described as a management / simulation game with perma-death. you're assigned as the administrator of a facility hosting [strike]scps[/strike] abnormalities. lobotomy corp has developed technology to harvest energy from these abnormalities as a saving grace for humanity. sounds easy right? well not really.  every abnormality is unique and has its own fully fleshed out character. but just like scps abnormalities can wreak havoc given the chance. as the administrator not only is it your job to keep these abnormalities happy but it's also your job to keep your employees safe. easier said than done every employee comes with an array of stats that will detail how effectively and efficiently they can perform their job; whether their job be feeding an abnormality or caving the head in of one of their fellow employees.  the game itself doesn't give you much to go on in determining exactly how to handle abnormalities which does make the game a tad more difficult (i.e. what exactly having an employee perform a consesus with an abnormality actually does). there's also several mechanics in the game that are left unexplained and up to the player to figure out. it's a bit intuitive and there's a bit of a learning curve.  progression for story mode is divided into days with each day becoming progressively harder as new challenges continue to be added for the administrator to handle. at the start of each day you're allotted a number of employees who you can assign to each section of the facility to perform tasks for the abnormalities in that area. this adds an element of strategy to the game as the player is forced to divvy up exactly who he wants where to match the preferences of the abnormalities etc.  to actually complete a day players are required to (at least in the early days) harvest a specific amount of energy from the abnormalities in the facility. this is done by keeping all of the abnormalities in a good mood. likewise abnormalities in a terrible mood will also detract energy from the gauge along with going berserk on the employees.  the game is fairly straightforward with a slight undertone of complexity which makes for a very interesting game overall. to add the story also presents itself through the administrator's accompanying ai who drafts notes and details logs about ongoing events throughout the facility.  [h1]tl;dr[/h1]  i'd definitely recommend buying this game if you're interested in management / simulation games. i haven't had any performance issues though that's likely because the game is a smaller management game produced in unity.  i'd also highly encourage fans of scp to check the game out.",2016-12-17,2021-11-08,True,57,2,0.796675682067871094,1,True,False,True
