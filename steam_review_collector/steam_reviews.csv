appreciate that its the vision of a single developer who dreamed up the concept  coded the mechanics  wrote the dialogue  composed the music and designed the beautiful art of the game all on his own  This game undeniably has a really special charm to it  but here I am in the summer of my second year  with about 20 hours logged  and while I definitely dont regret purchasing the game  I cant bring myself to keep playing   First  the good  The masterfully done pixel art makes growing crops and filling out your farm a visually satisfying experience  Each season has its own distinct color palette  the character portraits are adorable  with dozens of different expressions for every character in town  and I especially like the way the world looks at night  Each season also has its own soundtrack  and though the developer is no Koji Kondo  the music he composed for the game is quality  better even than some game music written by dedicated composers  and theres a ton of it  The dialogue has a lot of character  the sound effects are great    everything about the experience that can be called creative or artistic is top notch  My issue with the game is more a problem of how it plays out   So  this game is tedious as all hell  Probably the most egregious example is the mines  the most game y part of the game  where you go through caves  mine ores and gems  and slay monsters for loot  Think top down Minecraft  I dont understand the need for this aspect of the game at all  I have no problem with the fantasy of it  swords and slimes co existing with cubicles and TV sets   its just terribly boring  Its fun in Minecraft because you can shape the world and theres a real element of exploration  but here  its just exhausting  Combat in this game is about as basic as it can get  and advancing through the mines is pure chance   you keep breaking rocks until you get lucky and find the way down  which sometimes takes forever  The only challenge in it is making sure you come prepared  with enough home grown food to get you through 5 levels of the mine shaft so you can get home  but so long as you do that  nothing bad can happen to you   Actually  nothing bad happens to you in this game at all  There is no such thing as a setback  Pests will never devour your crops  Your animals will never get sick  a fox will never steal into your chicken coop and make off with a chicken  you will never deal with droughts or floods  The game is a steady climb upward as your fields get wider and your barns get bigger  I wasnt expecting Rimworld  but the reason this game is tedious is that managing your farm isnt interesting work at all  There are no decisions to be made  really  Does is really matter what crop I grow  or whether I buy another goat or another cow instead Just make sure everything is watered   your daily chore  running around your field irrigating with your little watering can  and youll be fine  There have been a few times where Ive stopped playing because I knew I would have to wake up and water everything again and I just couldnt be bothered  On the plus side  this leads to you praying for rainy days that will spare you that drudgery  just like a real farmer  Most disappointing is the social mechanic of the game  which  had it been better  would have been enough to redeem everything else on its own  A lot of the incentive to grow certain crops or acquire certain resources  ores  fish  wood  etc  is to gift them to the townsfolk so that they like you better  They ask for items from time to time  and once you figure out what they like  you can gift them things on a weekly basis  but I dont see a point to it all  For all the seeming emphasis placed on the various townsfolk  there isnt hardly any narrative to the game  The villagers will interact with you  but almost never with each other   you unlock events based on how much they like you  but theres no sense of real community in Pelican Town  and your actions dont really impact the town all that much  So  while there is a good amount of well written dialogue  Im not too interested in putting in the time to help everyone out  since its basically just a matter of running around and giving people gifts twice a week  The lack of a really engaging story kills this aspect of the game  Theres a cast of fairly interesting characters  but as far as I can tell  they never get fleshed out  These people have known each other for how long There should be decades of gossip  rivalries  bonds  history between everyone else that you  the newcomer  gradually get let in on  but so far  I havent seen much of that  It feels more like everyone else moved there right when you did   Lacking a good reason to deeply engage with the management of your farm  or the other characters in Stardew Valley  what were left with is ultimately a beautifully polished Farmville  I dont regret buying the game  or the hours that Ive put into it so far  but I cant see myself playing the game further  I will absolutely be keeping an eye out for ConcernedApes next project  though",2020-04-14,2020-04-14,False,284,15,0.72361445426940918,33,True,False,False

are very samey  largely in part due to there being a very limited pool of rooms and enemies there are 35 total in the game and you see maybe a quarter of that number in each chapter     Much of the gameplay ends up revolving around the out of run progression systems  In theory this is fine  but in practice for this game at least it means that you will progress faster by intentionally dying or giving up actually trying on a run is often not in your best interest if you want to progress the story  which passively discourages you from actually playing the game     To add to the above  there are things like character dialogue  Most characters can only be spoken to once between runs  but to max out your relationship with them  you have to speak to them dozens of times  Supposedly you can speed this up by starting a run and immediately killing yourself  but this is just trash gameplay in fact  its practically an absence of gameplay     The between run upgrade system is grindy to a fault  Im told this gets better after you beat the game once because it will unlock more easily farmable materials by way of run modifiers  THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING AVAILABLE FROM THE START  because run modifiers are something that would help the game be less samey and grindy right from the get go     Upgrades called boons are seemingly designed to prevent you from ever feeling powerful  They very rarely synergize  and the ones that do are often designed to only interact with only one or two other specific upgrades for example the Zeus boon that makes your lightning ricochet more  That synergizes with the maybe 3 specific other upgrades that are also from Zeus that give you lightning  This adds to the repetition between runs in a huge way  because upgrades are basically just static things and dont dynamically change the game to any great degree  strike    The enemy armor mechanic seemingly scales to your damage as well  so even if you do get some 11000000 fun run  you will still have to spend whole minutes chipping at enemies with yellow health bars  strike Edit  This is incorrect  and I was misinformed on this point  I stand by the enemies with armor being way too damage spongey  but scaling is not actually present to this degree     There is really only one boss per chapter  and the boss is pretty much always the same  This isnt technically true because a couple of the bosses have slight variants where theyll use one or two attacks more often  or in a differently shaped pattern  but it never really changes your approach to the fights  This means in addition to the samey floors with the same enemies youve already seen dozens of times  you are guaranteed to see the same bosses every single time  ensuring every run feels exactly like the last    To its credit  it has a good deal of positives     Excellent art and style  no need to elaborate further as this is self evident    The different weapons you can choose before your run are meaningfully different and do offer wildly different playstyles  most notably the bow and the gun    Bosses are fun to fight  at least the first few times but as said in the negatives  they get repetitive fast  The bone hydra for example was a blast the first few times but now I consider it the easiest boss by far and dread having to spend time fighting it     The gameplay for the most part is fast and snappy  allowing for fun combo oriented play styles  The big exception is any enemy with armor  which essentially requires you to play much safer and slower as they can always attack you  In theory  you could dodge them every time and keep attacking them even if they are armored  but if they have any kind of AoE attack or there is another armored enemy nearby that can get you from behind this just isnt viable and there WILL be more than one armored enemy very often  meaning you have to play poke and run until the enemy armor is chipped off     Run modifiers apparently exist  Ive not reached them  but I would bet you could comfortably do it within 15 hours if youre decent at video games  From what Ive seen of them by googling  they dont seem to change the game to such a degree that Im interested in continuing just for them  Again  I think that the game would have been better if these were available right at the start  because as is the game is much too samey    All in all  I give it a thumbs down if youre in it for the gameplay  The game doesnt feel like it was designed to be a roguelike  because roguelikes shine when the gameplay is notably unique from run to run and when the gameplay is more focused on runs themselves rather than the upgrading in between  and none of that is the case here  I wonder what the game would have looked like as a more linear experience

you find gameplay in games to be a very important aspect    Dont get me wrong  this game has an amazing story  cool characters  great lore  ton of content  beautiful stylized graphics    but gameplay itself is honestly very basic and bad  and as somebody who finds gameplay to be the most important part of games  I feel compelled to talk about it  While the combat itself is not awful  per se  its just not good enough to make me even want to actually play this game  much less   To put it simply  the base gameplay loop is just a lot of button mashing  The most prevalent strategy is to spam dash and attack  You may say Just dont  However  in this game   enemies are quite tanky  so it feels like youre putting yourself at a disadvantage by not using this tactic because it helps that much  Sure  there are different weapons and playstyles  and gods gifts that add some flavor to the gameplay  but that feeling that all youre doing is button mashing never goes away  The only weapon that I found to be unique is Bow and supposedly a Gun  but I havent grinded to it yet in the fact that  well  its a bow  and you have to charge it before each shot  However it still relies heavily on button mashing   I have few issues with gameplay itself as well  There are few  Firstly  why does your character completely stops when attacking In a game that is so fast paced  it makes combat feel rather awkward  and only facilitates supremacy of dash and attacks mashing tactic  This is such a small thing  that when added to other can lead to bigger frustrations  Call this a nitpick  but to me this feels like a small issue  that  like a broken immunity in a living organism  when present makes other issues worse    The other issue is that Its really hard to see anything  While the game is pretty  everything is just so flashy that most of the time you take damage  you dont even know what hit you  Adding this to whole spam thing  and you can take whole lot of damage from seemingly out of nowhere   And  if Im being honest  the biggest issue for me is that this whole button mashing deal just makes my hands tired and head  because it feels like you constantly have to move  which is probably my biggest issue with combat   Technically  you can unlock weapon aspects  which supposedly do add quite a bit of weapon variety and are kind of cool  not gonna lie  but you need to do quite a bit of grinding to unlock even one for a single weapon  which brings me to another issue I have with these game   The game is very grindy  not only when it comes to stats  but also with its story  Let me explain  Everytime you die  theres always at least one NPC that has new things to say to you  Which is great in a sense that theres always something that makes your death worth it  and if you are as fascinated in ancient mythology in media as I am  youre gonna have a blast  However  the issue is that you get those story moments and character interactions in such tiny drops  that it leaves you wanting more  which combined with the gameplay issues I mentioned previously  only makes me frustrated because if I want to learn more of a story I have to engage with the systems  which makes me hesitant to even play in the first place because of the same gameplay issues  To put it simply  you cant escape the gameplay if you only care about the story  This paragraph is more of a response to some people who claim that who cares about gameplay  if the story is good  I mean  sure  if that works for you  but why would I bother playing b a game b if I dont want to engage in gameplay What stops me from just watching some playthroughs on youtube  and not bothering with anything else Just some food for thoughts  Anyway  there are few other small issues  which I just want to point out are not necessarily good  nor bad  Certain base elements that dont unlock until awhile in your game  While this specific example doesnt affect the game much  there are other similar base elements that are hidden behind play time  like  for example  character stats  which you can upgrade to become stronger and get higher chance of finishing the run  Which is not a bad thing  but they add to the overall grind  and make you feel like the game doesnt want you to be able to finish the game until you upgrade those enough  Again  I just want to be clear  I dont think those design decisions are simply bad and need to be removed or anything  but I just want to give different perspective on why these aspects are not as simple as they might seem   The last issue I have with this game is absolute lack of accessibility options  This is bad  This game has God Mode  which increases your damage reduction by 20 when activated  and this number increases by 2 every time you die  up to 80  This is it  This is better than nothing  of course  but wheres everything else Theres no colorblindness options  no hold button to continuously attack button  or even basic text size increase  Nothing  With recent leaps in accessibility its really hard to excuse this lack of anything in a modern game  For how much deserved criticism Last Of Us 2 got  its accessibility options are fantastic  Even Dead Cells  game sharing similar niche  recently got a fantastic update adding ton of good accessibility options  This is not even a nitpick  You know how you can fix not seeing anything while in combat Add outlines to everything  and allow us to customize them  Accessibility options are useful even to regular players  The lack of those in this game is just puzzling   Anyway  heres my review of issues this game has  which I couldnt not mention  I probably need to add this last paragraph to all my reviews  but I dont like redundancy  so it will stay here   In case this review gets picked up by some steam algorithms or whatever  or some youtuber makes one of those dumb reacting to negative reviews videos  let me tell you this    The reason why any game should be suggested to criticism is because no work of human can reach perfect state  yet it doest mean we should stop trying  Any game has flaws  and the way each developers tries to perfect their product is what I find fascinating in this industry  Of course  in the recent years games have become more of a source of income  business  so to say  yet games are still an art form  and most developers do try to make a great game  which is why these sort of critiques are important  I think  To show the way these games can be improved  Frankly  I cant say that I have any authority to say that this review is anything more than just my opinion  and if it will resonate with anyone  but I still found it in me to write it  since I find the discussion itself to be most important part of these  since it generates different views from different perspectives  and damn me if those discussions arent great to be a part of    People who are the most negative usually are the ones who care about the game the most  If I didnt care  I would drop this game and forget about it  Yet here I am   Thank you for finishing reading this reviews of somebody who just has too much free time  and sorry for having to suffer through all the

a Supergiant game  go ahead  If you want to play a good roguelite  look elsewhere          Hades is very interesting its made me rethink the way that I measure out the quality of games  Its made me think about what a “good game” truly is  Its made it much easier for me to examine and understand why I hate dating simulators and visual novels       This insight isnt because its a 1010 masterpiece   Id say its a solid 710  Maybe a 610 when I see the same room layout for the third time that day  or the blandness of all the weapons starts to make combat run together into a mush  It instantly drops to a 310 if my hammers little upgrades that the game is very stingy with give me boring options  Roguelites and roguelikes even more so   more on that later heavily depend on gameplay variance  and Hades very often struggles with this  There is a good reason  though  Hades is a Supergiant game before its a roguelite    This isnt what I was promised  but its what I should have expected       I havent played any other Supergiant games  but Ive heard plenty of people talk about them  Story  characters  art  atmosphere  and sound  These are the most important parts of a Supergiant game  and Hades has it in spades  It has a lot more  even  the similarities between Thagreus and Hades voice patterns the ways that Elysium slowly introduces you to the mechanics of the bossfight before you actually fight them the furies changing up just as you get used to fighting Meg Hermess keepsake the voice acting the character design   I could go on      All this to say that Hades is a supremely crafted game  and every second of care   every drop of passion   is magnified in its presentation  Its a middling roguelite  though       Over my time playing through this game  Ive noticed that there are two qualities that a roguelitelike needs to be a good game  Its a bit convoluted  but its the best way I can think of to clearly explain whats wrong with Hades  inter  and intra run variance  “Intra” refers to games changing up gameplay mid run  while “inter” refers to changes between each run  Both of these are necessary to make a good “roguey” game that doesnt end up feeling like Malt O Meal in your brain  Usually  roguelites will focus on inter run variance  while roguelikes will focus on intra run variance  Hades follows this rule in an interesting but ultimately ineffective way       While most roguelites have you collecting power ups between runs  driving you to move forward through a feeling of getting stronger and improving via gameplay  Hadess primary motivator is story  Your relationship to the various characters throughout the world can be advanced in a visual novel style progression of “giving them a universal love currency ” You can only give one love potion to each character that may or may not show up in the hub per run  As you progress in the game  the story of each character slowly unfolds  masterfully giving you a glimpse of not just the characters you talk to  but the world that the game takes place in  Id actually like it if the other driving forces of variance werent utterly bland  There are six different weapons  each with four different variants aspects  This should in theory provide 24 different ways to play  In practice  most of the weapons feel like aspects of some common ancestor blunt object  and the aspects themselves feel like banal power ups  Power ups have their own issues  though  First  there are the hammers  the only source of meaningful intra run variance  Theyre heavily RNG gated   and even then  they only spice up the gameplay on occasion  Often  theyll simply boost your numbers or give you something boring like being able to attack repeatedly with a button held down  Then there are the boons  the “real” power ups  They almost never meaningfully change the way you play the game and even then  when they do change up gameplay  they often serve to make it more boring  such as Aress “Doom” mechanic  and on most occasions act as increases to numbers accompanied by fancy graphics  Thats not even the real issue with combat  though  the real issue is that weapon progression is paced awfully  The process of farming up the item required to unlock the different aspects of each weapon Titan Blood is like pulling teeth  This would be fine if each weapon had enough depth to warrant waiting that long to unlock new abilities  but theyre mind numbingly flat  The optimal techniques and strategies for each weapon will usually reveal themselves by the third area of your first run with the weapon or the first area of your second run  There are two possible reasons that titan blood is as scarce as it is to pad out play time  or to scale with the progression of players who arent as good at the game   With the quality and forethought on display for the rest of the game  Im more inclined to assume the latter  As I said before  Hades isnt a bad game   its just a mediocre roguelite   The story is swiftly losing my interest  and a dull curiosity along with a feeling of “maybe it gets better soon and I can write a better review” is currently the only thing keeping the game installed on my computer  Perhaps there is a fantastic and intricate roguelite buried under another 30 hours of trudging  but the opportunity cost is too high for me to care  Like The Witcher 3  his game isnt made for me

gorgeous art style  and hundreds of hours worth of replayability  But do I like it  No  no I do not   For me at least  Hades turns into a tedious slog after simply a few hours  Playing another round on Hades quickly turned into a chore  a pale task  This is due to a multitude of reasons  as I feel while the core game play is a refined fine tuned wonderland  everything surrounding it bogs it down so heftily that simply enjoying the game itself turns near impossible for me     h1 Rogue lite h1  I do not enjoy rogue likes  and especially not rogue lites  It is rare for me to enjoy any rogue litelike game long term  especially beyond a couple hours  This is due to the fact how rogue lites enforce their game play ideology  they do not want you to win  They really dont Im so tired of dying over  and over  and over  again  again  and again and every single time having to invest 40 minutes into some nothing burger of a run  Every early game runs feels so daunting  overwhelming like youre just nowhere near prepared to even clear the first level yet  because you arent  With the game intentionally making you extremely weak  fragile  it therefore craves you to grind for hours on end throughout double digit amount of runs before you can even stand a chance to maybe win  And Im so tired of rogue likelites  and their procedurally generated worlds  It feels so refreshing nowadays whenever I see an actual vision of a world in a game  where the game play is crafted to flow smoothly  spaces are memorable because theyre static   Zagreus is pathetic    with tightly limited amount of resources  it pushes you into investing many hours  many runs  before the game will even allow you to win not because theres a blockade stopping you  but because late game enemies are so spongy  tanky that beating Hades within your first 30 or so attempts becomes outright improbable for any common player  The game does not want you to get better  the game wants you to just grind until the game becomes a cakewalk  I cannot appreciate such a game play mentality  I do not want to waste 20 hours before the game will even think of me as worthy enough to beat it  If I start a game  I want to be able to be able to beat it through pure skill  not through grinded items or luck     So much of this game is based upon luck  How difficult the next room will be  what individual challenge is behind each door  what upgrade you get  which upgrades you can pick from  the strength of your upgrades  if you get to meet that one specific NPC  and whether or not you will get your sht kicked in thats all up to a dice roll to decide  I absolutely despise that Simple RNG luck can either make or break your entire run  regardless of your skill level or how much youve grinded so far  Im so tired of playing entire runs without ever encountering any useful items  It tires me  its pure dread  Whether or not I waste my entire time in this game should never be up to a roll of RNG luck  Eventually  I got so exhausted from even playing runs so I simply stopped caring  I didnt care whether I won or lost  how shtty my RNG was  or how well I performed    I gave up  such were no longer my goals within this game  I only played to get more dialogue from the in game characters    I am not kidding  I love the characters in this game Theyre funny  interesting  and witty  But of course  with such a fragile willpower to even continue playing  I completely stopped playing ever again  I lost interest  I got so extremely bored  it all got so dull  repetitive    Utmost certainly does not help how exhausting each run of Hades is  with so many ongoing systems  and focuses on hey you gotta do this to unlock this thing for this personyourself notes I became overwhelmed very easily  Id be utterly burnt out after single game of Hades  I had to stop afterwards and take lengthy break  Breaks usually lasting 2 weeks or longer  as playing a single run of Hades became such a daunting  monotonous  mondayne  and careless experience for me  And returning after 2 weeks and trying to pick up the sticks once more  trying to relearn the mechanics became a chore  daunting  There is not enough reminders  tips  and no tutorial to return to in this game  So it felt like returning to even try and playing it once more simply pushed me further away     h1 Combat h1  The combat is fun  instantly gratifying  and with its many hundreds of different applicable combinations of upgrades  play styles it encourages a wonderland of mayhem experimentation capable of benefiting almost any players play style  But at such point  I cannot help but wonder why even bother trying out new stuff If I still can keep the same  strong sword all throughout with no cooldowns or durability  and same with upgrades  then why bother trying out new items If I have to base my weapon on my personal play style  why try another weapon that would mess up my entire flow Why choose an upgrade Ive never seen before over one I know in n out I feel there should have been some sort of system to enforce a juggle of experimentation with multiple different weapons  systems  Some simple enforces akin to Legend of Zelda  Breath of the Wilds item durability in some form  I feel this wouldve simply helped the game do better  as runs become samey under the same play style after only a couple of hours  Its simple  flawed but good enough for what it is     h1 Soundtrack h1  The score of Hades is definitely the best part about it  From the melancholy tunes to the hard hitting rancid jams  Darren Korb returns once more with another epic beautifully constructed soundtrack  wonderfully fitting the games atmosphere  style  With its many songs fluently giving you goosebumps  alongside unforgettable jams to bop your head to during  afterwards playing the game  If it had not been for the art style  dialogue  and most of all    the soundtrack    I would not have sunken nearly 10 hours into this video game  Darren Korb never disappoints    h1 Conclusion h1  Hades is a great game many will enjoy  with undeniably hundreds of pros capable of being nitpicked    but it is not a game that appeals to me  I am tired of rogue likeslites already  There are so many on the market  and I do not feel any of them have improved or built upon the rogue likelite system in any game play ideology altering ways  so they end up feeling samey  repetitive  And Im even more tired of replaying a run for the 20th time and my biggest chance of victory to be be based upon on how many runs Ive played beforehand  RNG luck   Still  if you liked Enter the Gungeon youll love Hades  But if youre like me  then Id much rather play something else  I think if Hades had just been a linear  8 10 hour long static campaign  then I would have adored it so much more  It would have fixed nearly every problem I had with it But still  if it had went in such a direction it would not be the same Hades no more   But Im still glad I checked this game out I had fun in a few occasions  the combat was pretty neat  and it has some exciting challenges to overcome  If I liked rogue lites Id be here slobbering all over

interesting allegations about the game  I listened to those brief complaints and thought nothing more for sometime after  Then another friend played it and talked about it  Then I found out the game had 40 000 reviews at 99 positive  Its one of the top rated games on Steam right now  with it currently totaling 60 000 at 98 positive  To put it short  my interest was piqued  I wanted to see what the buzz was all about  I also ended up looking over those allegations with a third friend for additional verification  And I found some interesting stuff   Lets stick to the games content for a brief bit before getting to the real meat of the discussion  Vampire Survivors is a 2D rogue lite focused on killing monsters and surviving  The store page describes the gameplay as minimalistic and I couldnt agree more  Every attack is automated  the only player input is walking around and choosing one of three items every time you level up  Its pretty barebones  especially when the numerous enemy types all feel the same  The empty and procedurally generated boring mass of land the first level offers doesnt help either  Nor the straight line of nothing that the library offers  The default walk speed is a snails pace  so its not even like circling the enemies a hundred times over is fast paced either  The constant stops in gameplay are the final nail in the coffin for me  Leveling up as a new player makes you stop and read every minute  which brings the pacing to a complete stop  But dont even get me started on the item chests  Opening a chest freezes the game and forces you to watch an animation that varies in length from 10 to 20 seconds  Doesnt sound like much but after seeing it a dozen times from my very short play session  it quickly became an annoyance  Its a game that plays itself and some people are after just turning their brain off every now and then  But I dont even understand that appeal because of those constant stops  The hour I played felt like it lasted twice as long because of how slow paced it all felt  Ive played free flash games with about as much engagement as this  Playing the game quickly became a chore to check off if what I heard about the game was true  While I may have found the game boring  it wouldnt have gotten my attention if that was it   But that wasnt it  I first heard about the game because of some allegations of stolen artwork with the sprite art  Now these are very serious allegations that I didnt wanna just throw around  So I had to get digging and with a friends help  we found some interesting stuff  To start the sprite work wasnt made by the developer  It was purchased as a Patreon bundle through Oryx Design Lab  with the sprites originally being made for a Castlevania fan game  These sprites are a combination of minor edits  recolors  and straight rips of art found throughout numerous Castlevania games  A few examples are provided below  With the items  the bottom one is the original sprite with the Vampire Survivors version being on top  And with the enemies  the right version is the Vampire Survivors version  But you shouldnt need clarification  since they are so vastly different after all Additionally  the cover art features two near complete traces of cover art from Bayonetta and Castlevania  The Bayonetta one is particularly egregious since everything waist up is traced  The Vampire Survivors lady even looks weird when you see her hands without the magic blocking them since it looks like shes holding a gun  I kind of have to wonder why the art was traced because after looking through other works of the artist responsible  it seems like this is a one time scenario  I am more than welcome to be proven wrong with any of my provided examples  In fact  if any mistakes were made  please point them out  https steamcommunity comsharedfilesfiledetailsid2782328525 https steamcommunity comsharedfilesfiledetailsid2782329907 Now what interests me  even more  is the response Ive seen to these allegations from both the community and the developer  According to a resetera post from the developer  the art isnt stolen because he bought it from someone  As buying art that someone else stole magically washes away the fact that it was stolen  The developer has been pretty well aware that the sprite work is similar beyond a reasonable doubt for quite a while now and has continued to use assets from that pack  As a side note  Im never committing time to research on that hellsite again  But oh my god the braindead takes Ive seen from people defending the stolen art has fueled me with the energy needed to go to wastes of code like that site  From comments on the tracing saying You cant own a pose to saying the blatant art theft is just an inspiration   And look originality is hard when hundreds of thousands of ideas have been executed  Characters like Dracula and the Grim Reaper have hundreds of incarnations throughout media and art  but that doesnt mean one Grim Reaper is ripping another off purely by sharing names  But thats a different case when both Grim Reapers are orange and have the exact same silhouette  Undertale is inspired by Earthbound  A Hat in Time is inspired by Mario 64  and Lethal League took inspiration from Jet Set Radio  Claiming that any of these games ripped off another just because they have similar art direction or gameplay is incredibly dishonest  But when the only differences in your visuals are one has a different coat of paint and is slightly thinner  you start exiting the territory of inspired and entering the realm of plagiarism  Besides  its not like the stolen art is even that good Not saying that would excuse the blatant art theft  but it would at least mean the game looks nicer And while you cant own a pose  you can own art  The ostrich like behavior Ive seen from people looking at carbon copied artwork has been baffling  Sticking your head in the ground over a problem just because you like it is not only obnoxious but ruins the industry  https steamcommunity comsharedfilesfiledetailsid2782330371 As for a bunch of miscellaneous stuff to wrap up the review  The soundtrack is incredibly repetitive and if I was ever forced to play the game again  Im turning it off  The game expects you to grind for hours on end to unlock everything for incredibly interesting rewards  Sarcasm aside  Im not spending 40 hours to deal 5 more damage or walk slightly faster  Unlocks as a whole kinda suffer because everything is automated  The weapons I enjoyed the most were the knife and garlic just because I had some control over them  On a positive note  the games only worth 3 Its really hard to get any praise from me on the game to be completely honest  Maybe Im just a regular hater of whats popular  but Im just not understanding the appeal of the game   But you know whats the best part of an early access game by an indie developer Everything can be subject to change  I dont think Ill ever enjoy the gameplay  but that doesnt mean the artwork has to stay stolen  Like I said earlier the game exploded in popularity out of nowhere and that means more funds for the developer  Developers bringing back the support theyve gotten to the community by improving their game isnt unheard of  Making actually original art by hiring an artist will not only make the game look way better  but it also wont be art theft anymore Criticism is how games improve  I have hope that the developer continues to improve the game  bCurrently  though  I have to give the game something around a 110 b Id rather spend my 3 on a good cup of coffee or bag of MMs than a freeware game  And I am by no means wishing harassment of any kind towards the indie developer  as the stolen art is effectively the result of a con

Thoughtsth tr tr 	tdWhile there is plenty of character and item variety  player power grows to such an extent that it hardly matters  Past ten or twenty hours  every run fundamentally felt the exact same except when going after a particularly gimmicky unlock td tr table    h3Technical Issues and Performanceh3 VS performs quite badly overall  and the first sign of that is a launch option called GPU Lag Fix  Regardless of your hardware  Vampire Survivors will eventually lag and stutter as an issue between its engine and the absolutely ludicrous effects  numbers  and entities on screen  That being said  lag is never really an issue for your raw gameplay  as at that point any semblance of actual input by the player is no longer required to progress and is merely an annoyance while farming  In the 54 hours it took me to finish with 100 achievements  the game never crashed  nor did I experience any gamebreaking bugs or glitches  However  the enemy A I  is noticeably awful  and even as they generally just try to fuse their model with the player as a means of killing them  they still have a tendency to clip through terrain that should be inaccessible to them  like walls or pits  or get stuck on regular map architecture    h3Story and Settingh3 Theres none  Vampire Survivors does not feature an overarching narrative but instead opts for a comedic and often referential approach in the little writing it employs  This is in the form of a bestiary that occasionally does feel like an attempt at some shallow worldbuilding but shouldnt ever be mistaken for an attempt at a story  Besides the comedic writing  some maps leading up to the final map of the main game are designed to be surreal and toy with breaking the fourth wall as a means to engage the player  I quite enjoyed these small sections  although this approach seems to have been entirely abandoned for the DLC and is simply far too rare to recommend the game on the basis of them   h3Graphics and Soundh3 VS can look quite good for what it is  Naturally  the game has barely any system requirements to begin with and is thus fairly limited in what it can portray in the first place  But despite this minimalism  characters  both the different PCs and enemies  look distinct at a glance and even have some memorable details on occasion   The music is surprisingly good and excels especially for different character themes while not every unlockable character gets their own theme and thus stage music may or may not grow repetitive  the tracks that do stand out  like Pugnalas ‘Red and Blue are stellar and worth listening to even outside of playing the game   h3Gameplay and Difficultyh3 The basic gameplay loop of Vampire Survivors is simple but actually quite engaging  In general  the player only ever controls their own character through the movement keys  while combat and aiming are done automatically  Enemies approach from all sides  and youre merely trying to move in an efficient way so as to damage enemies  avoid damage yourself  and be able to collect dropped experience and items as you progress through a map  This makes the choice of which weapon to pursue more important in the early game  as itll tweak how you actively play the game  These may range from the knife  which shoots immediately and only in the direction youre looking towards  to more defensive variants like the bible  which orbits around the PC like a shield  With early game  I am not referring to the early game of a single map but rather the first few hours in which the player has yet to unlock any of the more powerful items for their runs   These first few hours are genuinely quite fun and can even be reasonably challenging however  I am wondering if this is something that the countless VS derivatives also suffer from  a ridiculous power creep that only ever gets monumentally more impactful with every unlock  These are tracked through a submenu and also equal the primary progression path for the player  besides unlocking the next map  The experience here is that once the player unlocks the ability or otherwise figures out how to evolve their weapons and starts to have just a modicum of an idea of just how VS works  it becomes a trivial experience  Aside from numerical concepts such as the effectiveness of weapons  there are aspects that are simply highly exploitable  such as  for example  the game fundamentally trying to achieve an entity density at any given point in a map  This means that strategies that could be conceived  like a movement build for kiting  are inherently worthless    Past this very early stage  VS coalesces into a gameplay loop that consists of setting up the most basic skeleton of the items you want by the end and past the first few minutes idling with little interruption  as the basic power level of the player is so ridiculously high that regular maps pose no threat almost regardless of what spawnsevery spawn  naturally  also being entirely scripted  This doesnt mean that interactivity itself isnt present past that point rather  the player is encouraged to collect items and secrets  which all just further this inherent problem of making the next map just a tiny bit less interactive than the one before   What it comes down to is that Vampire Survivors ends up playing like Cookie Clicker with extra steps  It evolves into what can only really be described as an idle game that has an annoying tendency to sometimes punish idling until youre free to ignore virtually all of the games once engaging mechanics when you get to the late game  when VS truly just becomes a game of picking your favorite near immortal character and farming for endless amounts of stat bonuses you never needed in the first place to be just as effective  The DLC is particularly bad for this  as the maps are genuinely well designed and fun to play but simply end up serving as another brainless unlock as a victim of that exact same power creep   h3Final Thoughtsh3 When I ask myself  Did I have fun playing Vampire Survivors Really have fun  like in any other ‘regular video game  Then no  I didnt  The first few hours are entertaining when there is still some sort of actual process of experimentation involved  but after that point  it deteriorates so quickly and so willingly into an idle game that I cant really recommend it as a standalone experience  If you  however  are looking for exactly that  A more involved idle gamesomething to fill time with  say while playing an MMO and waiting for a raid to start or as a brief stimulant while workingthen sure  it might be an experience worthwhile  Id just question whether there arent better options available despite the already generous price

ended up playing OneShot last year out of a desire for a short  story driven game without much action or turn based combat  The protagonists design proooobably had something to do with it as well  Over the years Id occasionally see the game alluded to or referenced on the internet without knowing much about it myself  This lack of knowledge  as well as the gloomy visuals and cult following the game had amassed  cultivated this sense of mystery in my mind  I went into OneShot hearing it would be emotional and possibly similar to Undertale  but thats about it   The game begins with this very cold and oppressive atmosphere  Youre thrown into an empty and dream like environment with little direction or understanding as to why youre even there  The very beginning is a little monotonous but it works well in communicating Nikos unfamiliarity with the world  Quickly  though  does that oppressive feeling dissipate as you begin to interact with more NPCs  discover new parts of the map  and become familiar with Niko  Theres a sense of warmth to the game  Its a deteriorating world inhabited by hospitable people  and the environments are dim but illuminated by disparate light sources  Its a visual style I really like  The game was most evocative of single player Minecraft  of all things  with its somber piano music  blocky graphics  and vacuous worlds  OneShot feels a lot less desolate than that game though  and it conveys an atmosphere I havent seen anywhere else  On a first playthrough  there isnt much of an attempt at deeper character writing or relationships but I was pretty satisfied with what I had experienced  It wasnt amazing  nor particularly sad  but maybe it didnt need to be  I was glad to have played OneShot   spoilerHowever  the name is a lie  OneShot actually contains a second route referred to as the Solstice Run  which is basically the good route of the game  And man  I really did not like it  Its not that Im against the idea of the game betraying its own premise  I appreciate the ambition to expand upon the worldbuilding and story  Theres a lot you can do with a second  alternate route  I got the feeling I was exploring a small portion of a much larger world during my initial playthrough  so introducing some entirely new regions would serve as a natural extension in that regard  While there are some new rooms in the Solstice Run  theyre a part of the preexisting regions rather than completely new ones  I get it  game development is hard  so Ill be somewhat forgiving here  but its a bit of a missed opportunity spoiler  spoilerWhat really bothered me about the Solstice Run  however  was the narrative and change in pacing  I understand the developers wanting to try something different  which I respect  but its how they did it  The Solstice Run is this super meta  video gamey narrative where the world begins to collapse and glitch out essentially  It has the pacing of a disaster movie almost  Youre being funneled through this super high stakes story by these new characters that you barely get to know  They deliver this revelation about the world being a simulation of a dead world  and these characters exclusive to the Solstice Run are the only ones aware of it  And its like    why should I care Why should I care about any of these new characters who mainly function to relay exposition and transport Niko to the next region Why should I care about the video game being a simulation of a dead world when it feels so artificial and small When I dont know any of these characters on a deeper level A video game acknowledging its a video game doesnt impress me anymore  You have to have more to the narrative than that  and OneShots Solstice Run does not  I suppose the ending was a bit touching in hindsight  with Niko acknowledging the humanity in the World Machine  but otherwise I just dont think the route plays into OneShots strengths  Outside of the Solstice Run  its a game about taking in your surroundings and familiarizing yourself with an alien world  Solstice  though  leans too much on the meta elements without providing me with interesting characters or backstory beyond Its a video game from a dying world  The relationship between the player and Niko is also unfortunately downplayed here  They remember you at the beginning  go Oh yeah     and your relationship with them stops developing for the rest of the game  It was another strength of the first playthrough that is underutilized in Solstice  As it is  the route largely failed to elicit an emotional reaction out of me  and it diminished my opinion of the game as a whole spoiler  Im conflicted here  OneShot can be a very warm and tenderhearted game  which is a bit of a rarity  and is a very pleasant audio visual experience  Im glad I sought it out as I havent experienced anything else like it  Still  spoilerI am unsatisfied with the execution of the Solstice Run spoiler and I cant shake the feeling that there may be better ways to spend 9 hours of your time  I would not recommend purchasing it at full price ",2022-08-23,2022-09-12,False,33,1,0.654260158538818359,1,True,False,False

interface elements from RPG Maker engine  No  its not an role playing game at all  The game could be perfectly translated in the form of a visual novel  Would you call a visual novel a game  If the answer is no  you will be dissatisfied with OneShot  The game is incredibly linear  you progress from area to area collecting items  combining them andor using them on objects or NPCs   Find a tool  use it on an item in your inventory  attach one item to another  use it on an object or an NPC  door opens  There are 3 main areas  and each of them contains a couple of these puzzles  Almost every time its obvious what you are trying to achieve   Game designers tried their best to add a little more variety  You will find simple puzzles  some of them are actually quite interesting  one of them requires a bit of thinking   At the same time you are constantly reminded about imminent danger  you are literally told “you have only one shot ” Yet this is just a simple puzzle game  Player agency You can only further the linear plot  nothing more   You will get nearly the same experience from watching a detailed walkthrough video   h14th Wall Breaking Mechanicsh1  Lets address the main gimmick of the game   It pretends that you are interacting with a real world through your feline protagonist  You are told that you are a god  and Niko is your messiah   It doesnt end with writing  Gameplay mechanics rely on the game being a piece of software on your computer  For example  at certain points in the game you will be asked to look for a file in your iDocumentsi folder  If you open it in a text editor  you will see a sequence of letters you have to enter in the game as a password   I did encounter some issues though   list First of all  thats not 4th wall breaking  Youve never even established it  This is simply an intrusive attempt to talk to the player   If you  like me  are using a Microsoft account on your Windows machine  prepare to be addressed with your first name for the rest of the game  I think there was an option early in the game to change how Niko calls you  but I missed it  I dont like being called by my first name in videogames   There is no variety  its almost always about the filesystem  The first time you have to look for a text file  its fun  The next puzzle changes your desktop background  Another one is about moving game window around  The rest of the game you have to look for files in your iDocumentsi folder  and that was tiresome   By the way  do you like when things mess up with your machine without a warning  The game has to be in windowed mode sometimes  It shows up notification dialogs with messages addressing you by your name  other times there are gameplay mechanics which need the game to stay windowed  In fact  the game guide explicitly states fullscreen mode is not recommended  The window however is too tiny to be playable in windowed mode on a modern high resolution display   If you play in fullscreen  it enters windowed mode when gameplay requires it  This takes a lot from 4th wall breaking moments  there is no unexpectedness anymore   Finally  there are software bugs with some puzzles  At one point you will be required to run a separate executable file  but due to the way Windows processes interact with each other  for me  it didnt work the way it was supposed to  It took me some time in Google search  and I had to restart a few things  Looking through the forums  I was not alone at this  list  If you are trying to pretend the game world is a real thing running on my computer  you have to execute it perfectly  Otherwise the illusion is simply not there even with my willing suspension of disbelief   And even if I dont have to debug the game for 20 minutes to progress forward  theres really nothing that much new to say in metanarrative anymore  It has been done before   h1Charactersh1  They are forgettable   Even the main character you are supposed to care about  In OneShot  you are controlling actions of a naïve and curious child with as little backstory as humanly possible   Niko likes hazelnut pancakes  his mother  and walking through wheat fields   Who doesnt like tasty food  their most important relative  and scenic outdoors  Even Nikos gender is intentionally ambiguous  although I tend to think about him as a boy  He is innocent  likeable  and has no character flaws  Niko feels intentionally undeveloped so you would associate yourself with him  When it comes to character design  I can clearly see how someone is trying to trick my lizard brain into liking the character  Niko is a tiny fragile cat child   So  we like the protagonist because we dont have a choice  In general  this game does not give any   The most interesting part about the characters are visuals  But can you remember anything about the bird child with blue feathers aside from the fact she is a bird and acts like a child  h1The Worldh1  You  the player  clearly have to save this world  Otherwise everything will be lost  fall apart  and decay  Cue sad music  Here is a lightbulb  I mean  the Sun  which is your MacGuffin  the plot device which is supposed to push everything forward  Everyone likes you and helps you on your way  Now go  the world is counting on you   For a game relying on metanarrative that much this type of plot feels too cliché   Why are you trying to guilt trip the player into being responsible for a collapsing world youve just introduced Frankly I cared more about an innocent child who didnt belong to it  Even though Niko isnt written properly  I saved the cat on the first run without even knowing its a requirement for Solstice run   h1The Ploth1  Prepare for the most basic  literal  and unsatisfying explanation “this world is actually a simulated videogame  and you control it” you could possibly imagine  You are literally told the game is a virtual world created by someone who left messages for you   Personally Im too tired of the simulated world trope  There is nothing wrong with pretending that a player is in a fantasy location which exists somewhere  Your audience does not need convoluted explanations  you can always employ some magical plot device   Finally  the main villain is defeated by simply saying something along the lines “I dont hate you  I like you now” as if you tell a bully you like them  they will become your friend  I cant even bring up myself to take this lame message seriously   Things were done  words were said  but whats the ultimate moral of the whole story presented  I did not encounter a single original thought in it   Niko did not change through the game in any way  “Yup  Im still afraid of ladders ” the cat mentions   There is barely any emotional conflict because ultimately Niko is not responsible for anything happening  you are   If Niko were real  he would remember events of the game as some weird adventure which inflicted no change to his personality   h1Final thoughtsh1  After you complete it  OneShot leaves a warm and fuzzy feeling  and you are supposed to be a little sad  too  You will never see Niko again  you are told   You will never see a protagonist with the most basic mission ever  get back home in one piece to gorge on pancakes   You will never revisit other poorly written characters  you will never see again their 10 lines of dialogue   You will never launch the game again because there were only 6 hours worth of content in it   Isnt that a little sad Well  not really  It feels like you are being manipulated into feeling sad about leaving something you didnt even have to care about

hoped   The story is creative and feels engaging  but there should have been more of it  There are notes all around that you can read but there just wasnt enough substance from them overall  Many of the characters were interesting but only served the purpose of continuing your progress  There were even a couple very mysterious things that seemed to serve no purpose other than to make you curious about them  Understandably  the game is very short and only so much could be done in this amount of time  but its a very story driven game  and if you arent invested then it wont pay off   The graphics are fairly basic  but they get the job done  Early on the game seems too plain  with not a lot of variety in the level design  This gets a lot better in later levels  and isnt as noticeable  Some areas are beautifully done due with the details in the world and the color choices used  it just would have been nice to have the lesser areas fleshed out a bit more  The still image cut scenes are the highlights of the game as they add so much personality to the characters and atmosphere of the world  They absolutely carry the games emotional tone and each one is worthy of screenshotting   The gameplay is pretty much what youd expect from a puzzle adventure game  You walk around  interact with things  and talk to characters  You find objects that you can use  but sometimes have to combine them together  I didnt really have a problem with them  and Im glad things were kept simple and the amount of items low  Theres some annoyance when you try to use an item wrongly as the game will go through default interaction dialogue which can possibly be very long instead of short circuiting to something simple like this item has no use here   The level design is definitely empty at times  with certain sections existing only to force you to walk and make the world feel large  Luckily the game has a run option AND a fast travel option  even though the latter requires you to know the names of the places youve been and you cannot use it when inside   My biggest gripes come from the two key gimmicks of the game  both of which break the fourth wall   The first being that the main character talks directly to you  On its own this is fine  but the dialogue just feels cringey and bad during these segments  They all amount to the main character  Niko  speaking to you  expressing his thoughts  and asking you questions  but the dialogue choices given to you amount to simple yesno responses that Niko seems to accept and there is no further elaboration  The feeling I got from this was that Niko had so much to talk about  but could only have a one sided conversation  You are essentially a bland nothingness    If more dialogue exploration choices are not an option here  I feel it would have been better if Niko did not communicate with you directly  and only sensed a higher being in control  Kind of like The NeverEnding Story  In addition  when Niko talks about you to other characters  it leads to absolutely nothing  the characters really just dont care and dont question it  However    I DO like Nikos personality here  as he really does look up to you with admiration  Improving the connection that the player has with Niko would have greatly enhanced the game  especially the ending   The second gripe I have with the game involves gameplay outside of the game  Given that this is a feature listed on the store page  its not a spoiler   I really did not like that the game goes out of its way to mess with your system settings  Perhaps it would have been more acceptable if it reverted these changes after closing the game  It did not add anything to the experience  and only made things feel clunky and awkward  You are given the option to use full screen but are required to go into window mode to complete the game  Window mode itself is tiny  During these sections of the game  it basically hints at what you need to do  almost going as far as to tell you exactly what you need to do  I understand the need to help the player here  so they dont have to look at a walk through  but then what have you accomplished At best youve insulted their intelligence  and at worst youve made a convoluted game mechanic  This kills the eerie factor that the game had going for it   Without spoilers  much later in the game you are required to go a step further with this mechanic and while this was potentially a REALLY cool idea  it just doesnt work well  Perhaps this worked fine on older versions of Windows  but in my play through it required SO MUCH managing that it absolutely killed the experience for me  I admire what they were going for  but I feel the game would have been stronger without this  and this sort of idea would work great in a hacker sort of game   Post release there was a content update that added a sort of NewGame continuation of the story that has you revisit areas in a remixed way and touches on some pieces of the game that were originally dead ends  This is realistically more of a walking simulator than the base game  as theres very few puzzles or items  Theres a couple new characters and a lot of new scenes  The dialogue is atrocious here and its a chore to get through at times with a ton of pauses and     filler  In the end  you finally learn more details that were left out originally  but the majority of dialogue is just mindless rambling  And unless Im mistaken  during this campaign Niko still tries to talk to you  but you cannot respond at all until the very end  and Niko doesnt seem shocked at all that you finally said something after hours of silence  It seems like a major oversight in writing  as I couldnt find any story reason for this  I do think this additional content ties the game up and makes it feel complete  so I feel its kind of mandatory to make the game feel cleaner   OneShot is still a fine game at its core mainly carried by its story premise  atmosphere and characters  I think if the cut scenes werent so beautifully drawn and compelling  the game would fall into average indie game territory  Still  there is an insane amount of frustration and missed potential that leaves me feeling a bit letdown in the end ",2020-07-16,2020-07-16,False,8,3,0.527900993824005127,1,True,False,False

my feelings best  I dont think its a terrible game  And Ill acknowledge that maybe  as someone who has played a lot of excellent narrative games before  some of which were taking liberties with ‘traditional gameplay already  Im just too jaded to appreciate what iOneShoti has to offer  However I do think it has serious flaws that prevented me from enjoying it   To start with the positive  this game definitely has some very pretty and well defined aesthetics going for it  both in terms of visuals and music  And most of the puzzle aspects are pretty okay no fridge logic as far as Im concerned  But while the story is definitely not original youre guiding a cute character who ends up picking up the ‘sun of a ravaged world in the hopes of restoring it  something Im okay with  there was pretty much no attempt by the writers to make the player engage with the world or the main character in a way thats not artificial  The game shoots itself in the foot with two key aspects that end up pretty much ruining what by all means could have been an enjoyable experience   First  it objectively suffers from bad controls  and the map in particular seems to have been artificially expanded to increase the games length  In other terms  even though theres a run option and at some times  a fast travel feature  there still is way too much pointless walking  I felt like I lost half of my gameplay time just making my character move from point A to point B  and it was  for lack of a better word  boring  especially since the player is pretty much never rewarded with loreitemsadditional dialogue when trying to explore   However  the most disappointing part of the game  and the reason why Im giving it a negative review  is that the storytelling is sacrificed for the sake of showing off a lot of gimmicky gameplay mechanisms that range from tedious to infuriating  It starts with very basic things that I imagine probably feel novel to some people but personally made me roll my eyes and just put me off the game  for example  youre pretty much required to play in windowed mode  and cant adjust the size of the window spoilers  its way too small  While a fullscreen option is available  often the game will automatically switch to a window for meta gameplay reasons  Those same mechanics will require you to look for documents in your computers files to find codes  and other wonders of this type  that I found manipulative at best and intrusive at worst  for example spoileryour desktop wallpaper is changed without warning to give you hints to solve a puzzle  and the playable character will address you by your real name in an artificial and convoluted attempt to make you bond with them spoiler In the end  I reckon the developers thought theyd try something ‘new with meta elements that go beyond the game window  but I wish they had put this energy into the actual storytelling instead  to at least make those moments feel deserved  And unfortunately for me  Ive played other games before that do it way better and therefore did not get touched by iOneShoti in any significant way  While the first part of the game intrigued me  my goodwill eroded quickly and upon reaching the halfway point  I pretty much just wanted it to be over  This is a pity because there is potential in there  and some parts of the world building are genuinely cool I enjoyed reading the notes in the Barrens and piecing together the information on my own for example  Unfortunately  the pay off is weak  and the game is both too short and too long at the same time for its own good  and since it focuses wayyy too much on showing to the player how clever it is while failing to give depth to huh    pretty much all of its characters  it just could not get me invested at all  which is a pity for a story driven game  Even the final choice just smells of déjà vu   TLDR  iOneShoti has some charm  but fails to capitalise on it  The story itself is not interesting enough to justify 5h of running right and left through a mostly barren map  And it is in absolutely no way groundbreaking  except maybe for people whove never heard of metanarrative before  To become compelling  it could  and should have been streamlined way more  Had the devs done away with the pointless walking and the annoying 4th wall breaking  just kept the puzzles and fleshed out the NPCs  the playable character and the story  this would have been a nice little unpretentious experience  Obviously Im in a minority here  but I can throw my two cents and recommend instead way more well rounded games narrative games that bear some resemblance to iOneShoti  To people who enjoy meta gameplay elements that actually feel earned  Id advise to play iUndertalei  iThe Stanley Parablei or the excellent and too under appreciated iA House of Many Doorsi  And to those who are not avert to pixel games and want a great story rich  emotional and intelligent story that doesnt look down on the player  try Freebirds iTo The Mooni saga ",2021-10-24,2021-10-24,False,18,0,0.516892075538635254,3,True,False,False

Overwhelmingly Positive Reviews on Steam  I just had to try it  After trying it…  I am disappointed   I should make it clear that I didnt care for the gameplay in Oneshot  as I am not a fan of puzzles  I am particularly not a fan of puzzles where all the puzzle pieces are not shown to you i e  you need to explore the world in order to find the items  However  there were a couple of puzzles which very unique and interesting in this game  and they all involved fourth wall breaking  For example  when the game placed passwords in the Documents folderDesktop  I was especially impressed by a puzzle near the end of the 1st playthrough which required me to run another application and line it up with the Oneshot game  It was really cool  Still  I wouldnt exactly recommend this game to others for its puzzles   Similarly  I didnt care for the gameplay in Undertale either  What I like about Undertale is its story  and its the only reason I would recommend Undertale to others  Thats what I was expecting Oneshot to have  a great story  In Oneshot  theres essentially a different story depending on the playthrough  Completing the game once will get you a specific story  Completing the game again i e  new game plus in a special way will get you a continuation of the previous story  The first story is fine  but nothing special  The second story……requires you to make way too many logical leaps and it didnt work for me at all   The first story is essentially about getting Niko the character you play as home while at the same time saving the world theyre currently in  In order to do this  they have to place the sun lightbulb that theyre carrying into a tower  Niko wakes up very far from the tower  so you have to guide them through various stages in order to achieve the objective  In this story  the fourth wall breaking is essentially used to separate you  the player  from Niko  the character  The game wants to make it clear that you and Niko are separate beings and that youre essentially a God in this world  The reason this has to be done is because the game wants you to care about Niko and the worldthe worlds other residents  This is because near the end  you learn that you have to decide between saving Niko or saving the world  You cant save both   This is a moral dilemma that Ive seen far too often  not just in video games but in all types of media  Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few Still  the story can grip you if youre torn between the 2 decisions  Unfortunately  I wasnt  This is because I didnt really care for Niko nor the world  as I dont really know much about either of them  I am playing as Niko  and yet I barely know anything about him  I just know that hes a kid who misses his mom  Similarly  I barely know anything about the worlds residents  I spent like 5 minutes tops with any individual character  and even then I only got to know them on a surface level  So when I had to make the decision  I just chose what I thought was morally right saving the world instead of Niko and that was that  The end  I suspect this story would appeal to someone far more if they can get attached to Niko andor the world   The second story is where the writing becomes waaaaaaaaaaay too convoluted and bullshit  You have to make various logical leaps  some of which include  	 The entire world game is created by a large computer … within the game  ……   No its not  Its created by a developer and writers who wanted to give an in universe explanation of how the world can exist  	 Niko is a real person but everything else is code  I know hes not real GAME     Just because youre telling me hes real  doesnt make me believe it 	 Robots can be tamed given the ability to go outside of their programming if someone cares for them enough  ………  Thats not how that works  Get out of here with this power of friendship bullshit     Mind you  you have to accept logical leaps like the above in the span of like 2 3 hours  So theres no build upjustification for these ideas  Theyre just thrown at you and you have to accept it  This is all done with the goal of making you believe that the game is real and that your actions have meaning  as youre saving real entities  Unfortunately  the second story had the exact opposite effect on me  It completely took me out of the game  and therefore I cared even less about what happened to the characters   Comparing to Undertale  you have to make one logical leap  That the characters exist and therefore it is wrong to kill them  This is why the first story of Oneshot worked a lot better for me because you similarly only have to make the same  and more importantly only  logical leap   This game is trying to tell a story similar to Undertale where youre playing as a God and you have to save the world and its characters  Both games want you to believe that these characters are real to some extent  but Oneshot is trying way too hard in this manner and it had the exact opposite effect on me  Its OK if I just believe the characters exist in a soft way  You dont have to make up various bullshit reasons to go YOU DONT GET IT  THESE CHARACTERS ARE AS REAL AS YOU AND ME……  If you can suspend your belief long enough  I am pretty sure you would enjoy this story far more than I did ",2020-08-24,2020-08-24,False,4,2,0.495091348886489868,0,True,False,False

not to debug technical issues for two hours   Lets just say that the meta shenanigans this game touts so much only reliably works on Windows  just browse the games community page and youll find hundreds of posts complaining that certain puzzle elements dont work at all on some versions of macOS and some versions of some Linux distros   I use Fedora Linux 36 and    I got incredibly unlucky and I hit upon every snag that has been reported thus far  which is all related to the stuff thats not going inside the game engine   First  the game doesnt start  Now this is a very well known issue on modern Linux distros who have versions of the GNU C Library that OneShot does not like  Some people reported that it worked first try  Some other people  notably people who use Ubuntu 20 04 LTS  say they had to remove librt so 1 because thats complaining about glibc  Some other poor souls  like me  had to remove everything thats not strictly necessary as reported by ldd or the Steamworks API  I suspect this purge also caused issues further down the line  but Im leaving it in the spoilered section   Secondly  the game window doesnt scale which means youre stuck with a 640x480 window thats incredibly small and hard to read  if you have a 2560x1600 display like me  I usually just use fullscreen to solve this  but because of the shenanigans thats going on outside of the game window  its not recommended to do that  In fact  Ill take it to another level  the intended way to play OneShot is via a puny window that cant be rescaled to fit higher DPI screens  because the game wants to break free from that puny window to show you smokes and mirrors   Spoilers for the game starting from here  but TLDR the games tricks are so broken on my computer that it actually ruined the intended magical effect and just made my feel like an insane person trying to actually use Linux for gaming  The gimmicks aint great  and theyre straight up dreadful when they dont work   spoilerDuring the infamous wallpaper puzzle  the one in Glen where interacting with a terminal replaces your wallpaper with a pattern that shows the answer to a lights puzzle  I discovered that apparently whoever coded the Linux port failed to realize that some DEs  like GNOME and KDE  have multiple themes that can use different wallpapers  Im a dark mode user so I was furious when I saw that the game only replaced the wallpaper FOR THE LIGHT THEME  sighspoiler  spoilerI also couldnt get the magic film to show correctly  I used a guide  and Im not sure if this is a me problem or is the detection algorithm for when a window overflows into the edge of the screen is simply broken my DE or my OS  Still  a bad puzzle with a bad outcome spoiler  Finally  the trick that broke me  spoilerThe fucking clover app  So  when the game copied the `` executable to the Oneshot folder under Documents  it failed to account for the fact that that app relies on CPython and some precompiled Python libraries  and so it will simply fail to boot and youll be stuck with Niko going in cycles  A symlink from the Steam local files  where the real  working `` binary is  to the folder would work perfectly  Alas  when I tried to overlay the clover app over the game window  nothing happened  I tried to adjust a lot of things  I tried running the game under Wine again  but that just made it even more broken and unstable I tried just running the clover app from its original directory  but that didnt fix it I tried to copy the clover app to the intended directory and it still doesnt work I tried to copy the Python libraries but somehow the app just segfaults I tried to align the clover app to the equipped  flashing clover item perfectly  down to the pixel  and it still doesnt work spoiler  At this point I realized that my time has been thoroughly wasted and while I care a lot about Niko and their quest  there are some things in life that are best left not screwing your mind over   End major spoilers  Finally  lets quickly talk about things that arent related to the mountains of bugs I encountered  the pixel art is really great and stylish the music is mostly atmospheric and   quite depressing    but that helps to outline the glimpses of positivity you see throughout the game the environment design is stellar  although Im not sure starting your game in pure gloom and doom is a great kicker for the vast majority of us  maybe some people are into that Niko is the only source of warmth I get and    I really wanna learn more about them but this janky ass game doesnt allow me to  Oh well  farewell Niko    It feels like maybe this game has wrecked my already fragile soul too much by making me feel depressed for 3 hours straight and occasionally subjecting me to some bonafide jumpscares  in addition to the anger that steadily accumulated after the numerous times I had to deal with technical  game breaking issues   I wanna like this game  but with all that stress  all those bugs  and the lackluster

every single part of the game  and critique how it couldve been better  the entire rest of head space is essentially the same thing and so boring it can be summarized in a few paragraphs  Basically  you spend about 90 of your playtime in head space where the plot does not move forward  You just do a bunch of boring  pointless side quests that take forever   You do puzzles that are painfully easy  You fight billions of the same enemy  and most of the time turn your brain off and just spam the attack button  and this isnt even scratching the surface on how boring head space is  It got to the point that it took me a month and 13 days to finish this game because I kept taking breaks after enduring this slog fest   This whole thing combined leads to a repetitive cycle where you trudge through headspace hoping to reach the point where the plot progresses and you enter the real world  which usually only occurs at the end of each segment of head space  So you get a quick spooky event about the “truth ” then get sent to the real world   THE REAL WORLD  The real world consists of a few fetch quests and missions  and has some of the main problems from before  The best thing though is that it actually moves the central plot forward  and isnt entirely pointless in the grand scheme of things  However the main problem with the real world is that there are so many moments of character development that should be mandatory  such as the description KEL gives about HEROs depression when you interact with the Gravestone  I didnt even know about this in my playthrough  and its a pretty big plot point that should be expressed   Id also like to elaborate on the combat for a moment  The combat system with emotions is unique  but rarely utilized  Even if you wanted to use it for yourself you have 4 party members whose emotions need to be turned  That means 4 turns of using “Cheer ” or “Sad Poem ” or “Annoy ” Plus an extra turn if the enemys emotion needs to be changed In these 4 turns  you could deal so much damage  or be dealt so much damage that it becomes entirely pointless  And yes  I am aware of the items that make your entire party or foes a specific emotion  but those are later in the game and are classified as items  so they are meant to be single use and “powerful ”  Finally  the main part of the game that even kept me playing  The story and writing  To start  the game is very cheesy when it comes to its characters  I thought that this would be isolated to head space alone  but no  it carries over to the real world  Since the writing style stays the same  and none of the teenagers speak like teenagers They rarely curse at all  This game talks about suicide  so the game can handle curse words  Curse words are usually the best way to separate fantasy from reality because yes  people do curse in stressful situations and it helps emphasize the importance of the situation  the game ends up being pretty unrealistic and feels like youre reading a manga  not seeing an actual friend group going through a hard time  A good example of this is AUBREY  In about 3 days  after seeing SUNNY fully basically for the first time since MARIs death  and going through various mental breakdowns  AUBREY goes through the classic Family Guy “Aw geez  Ive been a real jerk ” then makes up with the entire party of friends  So youre telling me a person who held a grudge against their prior beloved friend group for years  to the point of which doing physical harm to them would just lose that grudge in days Yeah  okay   This game also terribly conveys depression  Suicide is a game mechanic  for some fucking reason  which is so insensitive and strange  The bad ending of the game also is just SUNNY killing himself with a banger song playing  which is just edgy and unnecessary  These moments seem to be just there for shock value  nothing more  The game wants to convey that SUNNY has depression  but instead shows that SUNNY is scared of spiders  heights  and swimming  and does not want to go outside  So basically SUNNY just has a bunch of phobias  and is extremely fucking guilty because of the twist more on that in a moment   SUNNY is also never smiling  ever  Which is strange  because most stories about suicide with personal experience here  too are shocking to surrounding friends and family because the person who committed suicide never seemed to express being depressed  or them in a state where theyd want to commit suicide But OMOCAT has a very 1 dimensional view of depression  The game portrays people who are depressed as “Depressed people are sad  They never smile  They commit suicide ” when it is far more complex than that   Now  coming to possibly the worst part of this game  the twist ending  We learn that SUNNY and BASIL killed MARI by pushing her down the stairs  then framing it as a suicide  So everything prior  SUNNY and BASILs “depression ” its not depression  Its guilt  MARI was never suicidal  she was killed  Which essentially means that what couldve been an interesting take on depression as MARI was always so happy and vibrant is destroyed by the fact that she never committed suicide and that it was framed  So all portrayals of depression in this game are fucking stupid and do not compare at all to the real world   Also  the twist makes no fucking sense  So MARI gets pushed by SUNNY down the stairs  Then she falls on a fragmented violin  If she wasnt bleeding before  she is now  Then  SUNNY drags her bloodied corpse back up the stairs  and lays her in her bed  So now there is blood everywhere across the house  Then  SUNNY and BASIL take her body which is still dripping blood everywhere to a tree  hoist up her 15 year old body with 12 year old noodle limbs  and then proceed to tie a noose around her head which is harder than it looks    Then the police had to either  A  Be extremely stupid and not notice the violin shards in the body  B  Not to be called  and the murder scene covered up by the parents  Also  we have to assume that SUNNYs mother did this on her own  because the father presumably left SUNNY because of this incident  Leaving your entire family is a big thing  and it would make no sense for the father to cover up the murder and then leave  He would most likely keep the murder to himself  but leave in disgust   Then the game portrays SUNNY and BASIL as sympathetic and innocent  Are you fucking kidding me The plan to cover it up as a suicide is ridiculous enough for 12 year old “innocent boys ” but even if they did come up with this plan  the adrenaline rush to cover it up wouldve been long gone after SUNNY put MARI back in her bed  This would be actually very interesting if the story was more of a “who dun it ” and we were watching psychopaths coming up with their plan  but instead were supposed to be watching innocent boys who made a mistake and are supposed to be forgiven and tell the truth  Yeah right   The thing is  there was even no need for this twist ending  I understand how subjective it may be  and you can fight tooth and nail claiming that “The ending is believable  its about being honest with yourself  etc ” But if the game really wanted to dive into depression  it couldve instead explored the very real situation of a person who appears to be happy and vibrant committing suicide  Instead we have a twist ending more because of “shock” than because of telling a good emotional story  ",2023-08-03,2023-08-11,False,72,4,0.703977227210998535,39,True,False,False

given its subject matter  Social anxiety  social withdraw  the divergence of relationships  and the desire to return to a previous time in your life are all ideas the game tackles in a relatable and down to earth way  However  spoilerthe plot twist the game hinges upon is fundamentally unrealistic  Ultimately  I didnt find the game emotionally resonant beyond a thematic level as a result  It utterly fails to justify the driving force of the story  a story mostly rooted in a grounded portrayal of reality  How did Basil possess the capability to stage a suicide How did Basil know how to tie a noose Was there an autopsy Do Sunnys parents know What are the implications of Basils psychology if he was able to stage a suicide and tie a noose at the age of 12 These are fundamental questions that go unanswered  nor can they be hand waved by them being children and acting irrationally in the moment  The resolve staging a suicide would necessitate is wildly out of character for an otherwise irresolute and submissive character like Basil spoiler  spoilerIf Undertale was a relatively short experience dense with detail  then Omori is the opposite  It is a bloated  elongated psychological horror RPG that is utterly disinterested in real world psychology  With a character like Basil  I dont feel like the thought process was  We will write this character around this specific psychiatric disorder and we will imply it through their actions and behavior  It was probably more like  This characters trauma has caused them to become delusional and suicidal  Okay  well why is he experiencing these delusions Trauma doesnt just cause you to experience hallucinations of the physical manifestation of your guilt  Basil is 16  Is he really that emotionally stunted and delusional that hes still trying to convince himself that something pushed Mari instead of Sunny Again  what are the implications for Basils character here The game is absolutely NOT interested in any of these questions  In the case of Sunnys hallucinations  So he saw Maris eye hanging open as he and Basil finished staging the suicide  so now he just sees a floating eye following him around everywhere  Its not just a metaphor for trauma or guilt because  as weve established  the two experience something as a delusion  In what way is ANY of this rooted in  you know  psychology And as for Omori  the character  The easiest conclusion you could make is that his existence implies Sunny has dissociative identity disorder  but its not like people with the condition can just overcome their alters in the way Sunny does with Omori  If Sunny wanted to forget the incident with Mari  then why is Omori named after the piano that is relevant to her deathspoiler  spoilerNot even Sunnys dreams feel particularly representative of how I  at least  experience dreams  Headspace is a consistent  never changing place that is incredibly divorced from reality  Speaking for myself  I dont encounter the exact same place repeatedly in my dreams  and they are typically based off of real world imagery  I dont really dream of cartoon monsters and neon colored fantasy worlds like Sunny does  The parallels between Headspace and the real world are few and superficial as well a few of the characters in Headspace exist in the real world as fictional characters  thats pretty much it  I just dont feel like Headspace really says much about Sunny  I suppose he has a rich imagination  although nothing in the real world implies he has any sort of creative inclination  and he obviously yearns for the way his life used to be  Theres not much more to it than that  and you spend a majority of the game in Headspace  It literally takes place in the protagonists mind and yet it says very little about either him or the story spoiler  Do you see what I mean Despite being initially billed as a psychological horror RPG  the game is uninterested in psychology  Its not interested in the implications or the particulars  I suppose you can just write a story about trauma and universal human struggles like depression and anxiety without delving much further  but it sort of feels like youre ignoring the elephant in the room  At best  the story doesnt take advantage of its premise and at worst it isnt thought out  I dont like how it deliberately wastes your time with Headspace just to build up momentum for the plot twist you could still have it be a cold burn while presenting players with plot and character relevant information more frequently   Now  despite all Ive said  I dont actually hate Omori  In fact  I actually quite enjoyed it when I first completed it  Even now I still have a fondness for the characters and the real world sections in particular  that is the one part of the game that most definitely sticks the landing  Its the reason you should even play the game in the first place  I just dont understand how it can be an incredibly sad story for so many people when I find it to be unrealistic and poorly thought out in the ways Ive outlined  I wouldve been fine with the twist conceptually if the game had justified it  but it didnt  Overall  Omori is okay  There are quite a few things I appreciated about it  but to call it a masterpiece of storytelling or gaming is a massive stretch when its writing in particular is deeply flawed  I dont regret the time I spent with it at all  Im glad I experienced it  but Id be hesitant to recommend this to others if they dont have a lot of patience or free time  As Ive said  I dont hate the game but Im giving it a thumbs down so

already given that part away  OMORI is one of my favorite games of all time  in fact  and I am going to refrain as much as possible from leaving any story based spoilers in this review because this game is and i cant stress this enough best experienced as blind as possible  and when you experience this game for the first time  theres no going back afterwards   That being said  there comes the reason I rate this game negatively bthis game is not for everyoneb  and this review is primarily for people reading through the negative reviews before buying the game out of skepticism for its overwhelmingly positive feedback  I dont blame anyone who does this  because some people want to know if a game is right for them before buying    I will run through the demographics who I dont recommend OMORI to  descending from most to least deal breaking   1  its just another quirky earthbound inspired indie jrpg about depression  Im certain that there are a few people who think this way about games that draw similarities to Undertale  a game that exploded into the mainstream around the time that indie games really started to make an impact around 2015 though this is up to debate  If the thought of there being a sub genre of Earthbound inspired indie JRPGs  or games that discuss depression as a central theme  keeps you awake at night because there is a supposed epidemic of these games that are lazy  half baked excuses for finished products being overrated by weebs  then Id stay as far away from this game as possible  OMORI inspires itself greatly on Earthbound and Yume Nikki with its wacky scenarios and themes about depression respectively traits that it wears on its sleeve  To many  thats not a big deal  Its a means to draw inspiration to a new product that does things differently in its own way  In my opinion  I think that classifying a game as a rip off and sign of laziness from the developer based off of surface level aspects is in and of itself a half assed excuse to not play a game while simultaneously disliking it because I just know its gonna be like every other xxyyzz clone out there  I know that the people who think this sort of thing are in the thankful minority  but my opinions are not here to change anyones mind on purpose  and are only here as a warning for those who are predisposed to dislike games like OMORI to give it a skip    2  You have little tolerance for quirky or weird humor  This game  like I said earlier  is heavily inspired by Earthbound  make of that what you will  It uses a lot of weird  cutesy  and quirky humor throughout the game that  while I found it nice enough and funny for the most part  other people may find it tiring and quirky may have some negative connotations depending on the person  Its true that I did find some of the humor a little stale at times  but it was not very often  Thankfully  the game never tries to be edgy and use its themes for shock humor  and the humor reserves itself to the more lighthearted moments of the game  Additionally  there are many moments throughout that elicit feelings other than haha funny that are thoroughly enjoyable  However  the quirk factor is a prevalent part of the game  and those who may find it tiring probably wouldnt feel too at home playing this game   3  You are unwilling to take the game as seriously as it takes itself  This one might sound a little pretentious  but I felt it necessary to bring this up too  This game takes itself seriously  and rightfully so  It covers serious topics that are not to be danced around lightly  So  if you might be inclined to believe that the game might not be in the right to take itself seriously in tandem with all of the goofy stuff that happens in the background  then the game might not leave a super great impression on you  as this game is at its best when it is serious  and when these moments are taken seriously   4  You are expecting high level and complex gameplay  This games main purpose for existing is  first and foremost  to tell a story through the medium of a game  not to be a game that also happens to tell a story  This was stated by OMOCAT herself at the beginning of the project  and it still rings true in the final game  Now  the gameplay is not ibadi by any means  but some who love games primarily based on gameplay and not story may come away with a few complaints  with good reason  This game is very easy  save for a few fights that are completely optional or impossible to access in the main route of the game  The games main combat system  revolving around 3 emotions in a rock paper scissors type effectiveness that gets the job done  Alongside this is the typical turn based RPG aspects deal damage  use items  buffdebuff  you get the idea  and when you put it all together  its pretty enjoyable  but not anything particularly groundbreaking save for a few fights where you actually need to use your brain  In addition to this  there are no random encounters in the overworld  and no grinding is required to get past bosses which relieves a lot of annoying aspects many turn based RPGs share  However  some may see this as under utilization of the games elements  which is fair enough it iisi a game after all  I would only see this as a reason to not buy the game if you do not care about the story in games like this at all   5  You are impatient  I am not looking to criticize anyone for being impatient  as most people do not have ample time to play video games  This is probably the most difficult argument to make  and also the one I see the most often in criticisms of this game because what constitutes poor pacing and a game that is too long varies incredibly widely from person to person  If you were to run through the game  doing a few side activities  reading the dialogue  not a whole lot of sidetracking  this game takes about 25 hours to complete  To me  25 hours is not a long game  but a decent length without overstaying its welcome playing through Persona 3  4 may have desensitized me to proper game length  seeing how long those games are  However  to a lot of people  that length of a game is too long  Many would prefer to squeeze a game that can be completed in a shorter time into their busy schedules  and for many  thats a deal breaker  In addition to this  there is the pacing of the game that is a little weird  shifting between 2 settings throughout the game with the majority of development occurring in one part while the other has noticeably less  I see the most criticism toward this aspect of the game  and many will feel a bit unsatisfied or bored by the pacing at first  I personally had very little issue with the pacing while playing and even came to appreciate it by the end due to the design and context within the game  but thats just the kind of thing that I like  Not everybody has to  and thats okay  If you think of yourself as someone who likes to see the end of things quickly  but still want to see OMORI through to the end  I recommend you go into this game with patience in mind  If you are uncertain about how patient you are with a game as long as OMORI  but all other aspects of the game interest you  Id recommend playing through LISA  The Painful beforehand  as it possesses many similar traits to OMORI  while many other ones distinguish the two greatly  but its half as long  If you liked LISA  then I think youd like OMORI too  and if you didnt like LISA because it felt too long  then you probably wouldnt like OMORI either  Keep in mind that I compared these games because

must be missing something that others saw  but upon closer inspection I am convinced I did not   Almost every part of this game  with a few exceptions  is not interesting enough to be justifiable  This begs the question of why a lot of it is there in the first place  I could ramble on about this or that  but bullet points would probably get the point across better    Combat  Its a JRPG  I took risks with my strategy to make it more interesting for myself  but never too interesting  Since you dont know what the boss is going to do to you before youve fought it  you are never granted the opportunity to outthink the game  Somewhat standard fare and the emotion mechanic is nominally interesting  Slight issue    Horror  There are a few good horror sections which are very close to the start  when you dont know whats going on at all  Once the rules of how the game will scare you are established  it does not transcend them enough to scare you again  Dips so far into creepypasta territory that it can be annoying  since the justification for the creepypasta is not explained until the end of the game  You will learn what you should be scared of but never a reason to fear it  I had the maximum random event value on my playthrough  Slight issue    Character writing  The characters  save for the protagonist  are not believable to me  As a result  I had a hard time taking the game seriously  which as other reviewers have pointed out  can be a death sentence for ones enjoyment of the story in this game  I am used to story games  but the characters spoke in platitudes so much that I could not summon a reason to care  Perhaps the reason I only liked the protagonist was that he never spoke and allowed me to project what I was feeling about the game  Moderate issue    Thematics and story  I have struggled with depression myself for longer than I can remember  This is not a good representation of my experience beyond a surface level  I wouldnt go as far as to say its dishonest or misguided  obviously it means different things to different people  and I respect that  But I could not gain any affinity for how this theme is presented in the story  Beyond that  the story contains only a few actual plot points  spread very thin over a grueling 25 hours of moping and coping  as well as what Im going to talk about below  And thats with me doing the route that has the most story  Moderate issue    Pacing and filler  And here we have by far the biggest problem  Other reviewers frame a distaste for the glacial pace  walking simulator sections  and cutscenes packed with nothing meaningful happening as impatience  I disagree  Impatience implies that there was something to wait for   and I didnt gain any value from the supposed payoff either  so what gives It feels like I wasted my time  There are long stretches of this game with positively nothing to sink your teeth into   to call it a bad gameplay loop would be an insult to gameplay  Worse yet  When I didnt know a certain ending was coming  I chose a wrong option and had to redo 40 minutes of unskippable cutscene  The game sums it up best itself  Waiting for something to happen Unfortunately  this is not entertaining  Severe issue    Side quests  I didnt do them  I dont know why anyone would  Baffling stuff given what else is out there    Art and music are good   610 for effort  but it missed the mark with me so severely that it turned into one of the worst slogs Ive had with gaming  If you have a high tolerance for nothing happening and are able to sustain yourself on pure atmosphere  you may still click with what this game does offer  This game made me feel bad  really bad  but not in the way it probably hoped to  Waiting for something to happen  Edit  my thanks to the fanatics and fellow critics alike for the awards  If you are a fanatic  I advise you not to harass negative reviewers of the game as I have seen in the comments of other reviews  That would be rather unbecoming of you   would the developers want that Just food for thought   Edit 2  610   410 because I think Ive figured out why people like it and now I like it even less  Its a bit odd to have a game where the protagonist undergoing deep personal introspection about his very personal trauma is central to the story  and yet choose for him to be silent  Its also a bit odd that the actual source of this trauma is a closely guarded secret  relegated to symbolism until the very end of the game  But it becomes less odd when you considered the consequences of these choices   a silent protagonist exhibiting every possible symptom of some unknown trauma and depression Why  its free real estate to project ones own trauma and depression onto  By their own admission many fans have an unhealthy relationship with this game   but that doesnt mean it was deep for getting you to feel those things OMORI casts a very wide net at times  and throws out so many things to relate to while making as few as possible things highly specific that anyone can be caught in its webs  A lot of fans are teens  especially at or after vulnerable points in their lives  This is not an open condemnation of this games theming as manipulative but I think its something worth questioning ",2022-01-19,2022-03-08,False,157,18,0.728455781936645508,0,True,False,False

recommend this game  but it is not for everyone   To put it bluntly  this game is long  Super long  The average playtime to finish this game is 20 hours  and most of that time is not spent progressing the plot  Its spent doing endless fetch quests  roaming around  fighting hordes of enemies  and reading so much dialogue that it can put some people to sleep 	   HEAD SPACE  While I could write about every single part of the game  and critique how it couldve been better  the entire rest of head space is essentially the same thing and so boring it can be summarized in a few paragraphs  Basically  you spend about 90 of your playtime in head space where the plot does not move forward  You just do a bunch of boring  pointless side quests that take forever   You do puzzles that are painfully easy  You fight billions of the same enemy  and most of the time turn your brain off and just spam the attack button  and this isnt even scratching the surface on how boring head space is  It got to the point that it took me a month and 13 days to finish this game because I kept taking breaks after enduring this slog fest   This whole thing combined leads to a repetitive cycle where you trudge through headspace hoping to reach the point where the plot progresses and you enter the real world  which usually only occurs at the end of each segment of head space  So you get a quick spooky event about the “truth ” then get sent to the real world   THE REAL WORLD  The real world consists of a few fetch quests and missions  and has some of the main problems from before  The best thing though is that it actually moves the central plot forward  and isnt entirely pointless in the grand scheme of things  However the main problem with the real world is that there are so many moments of character development that should be mandatory  such as the description KEL gives about HEROs depression when you interact with the Gravestone  I didnt even know about this in my playthrough  and its a pretty big plot point that should be expressed   Id also like to elaborate on the combat for a moment  The combat system with emotions is unique  but rarely utilized  Even if you wanted to use it for yourself you have 4 party members whose emotions need to be turned  That means 4 turns of using “Cheer ” or “Sad Poem ” or “Annoy ” Plus an extra turn if the enemys emotion needs to be changed In these 4 turns  you could deal so much damage  or be dealt so much damage that it becomes entirely pointless  And yes  I am aware of the items that make your entire party or foes a specific emotion  but those are later in the game and are classified as items  so they are meant to be single use and “powerful ”  Finally  the main part of the game that even kept me playing  The story and writing  To start  the game is very cheesy when it comes to its characters  I thought that this would be isolated to head space alone  but no  it carries over to the real world  Since the writing style stays the same  and none of the teenagers speak like teenagers They rarely curse at all  This game talks about suicide  so the game can handle curse words  Curse words are usually the best way to separate fantasy from reality because yes  people do curse in stressful situations and it helps emphasize the importance of the situation  the game ends up being pretty unrealistic and feels like youre reading a manga  not seeing an actual friend group going through a hard time  A good example of this is AUBREY  In about 3 days  after seeing SUNNY fully basically for the first time since MARIs death  and going through various mental breakdowns  AUBREY goes through the classic Family Guy “Aw geez  Ive been a real jerk ” then makes up with the entire party of friends  So youre telling me a person who held a grudge against their prior beloved friend group for years  to the point of which doing physical harm to them would just lose that grudge in days Yeah  okay   This game also terribly conveys depression  Suicide is a game mechanic  for some fucking reason  which is so insensitive and strange  The bad ending of the game also is just SUNNY killing himself with a banger song playing  which is just edgy and unnecessary  These moments seem to be just there for shock value  nothing more  The game wants to convey that SUNNY has depression  but instead shows that SUNNY is scared of spiders  heights  and swimming  and does not want to go outside  So basically SUNNY just has a bunch of phobias  and is extremely fucking guilty because of the twist more on that in a moment   SUNNY is also never smiling  ever  Which is strange  because most stories about suicide with personal experience here  too are shocking to surrounding friends and family because the person who committed suicide never seemed to express being depressed  or them in a state where theyd want to commit suicide But OMOCAT has a very 1 dimensional view of depression  The game portrays people who are depressed as “Depressed people are sad  They never smile  They commit suicide ” when it is far more complex than that   Now  coming to possibly the worst part of this game  the twist ending  We learn that SUNNY and BASIL killed MARI by pushing her down the stairs  then framing it as a suicide  So everything prior  SUNNY and BASILs “depression ” its not depression  Its guilt  MARI was never suicidal  she was killed  Which essentially means that what couldve been an interesting take on depression as MARI was always so happy and vibrant is destroyed by the fact that she never committed suicide and that it was framed  So all portrayals of depression in this game are fucking stupid and do not compare at all to the real world   Also  the twist makes no fucking sense  So MARI gets pushed by SUNNY down the stairs  Then she falls on a fragmented violin  If she wasnt bleeding before  she is now  Then  SUNNY drags her bloodied corpse back up the stairs  and lays her in her bed  So now there is blood everywhere across the house  Then  SUNNY and BASIL take her body which is still dripping blood everywhere to a tree  hoist up her 15 year old body with 12 year old noodle limbs  and then proceed to tie a noose around her head which is harder than it looks    Then the police had to either  A  Be extremely stupid and not notice the violin shards in the body  B  Not to be called  and the murder scene covered up by the parents  Also  we have to assume that SUNNYs mother did this on her own  because the father presumably left SUNNY because of this incident  Leaving your entire family is a big thing  and it would make no sense for the father to cover up the murder and then leave  He would most likely keep the murder to himself  but leave in disgust   Then the game portrays SUNNY and BASIL as sympathetic and innocent  Are you fucking kidding me The plan to cover it up as a suicide is ridiculous enough for 12 year old “innocent boys ” but even if they did come up with this plan  the adrenaline rush to cover it up wouldve been long gone after SUNNY put MARI back in her bed  This would be actually very interesting if the story was more of a “who dun it ” and we were watching psychopaths coming up with their plan  but instead were supposed to be watching innocent boys who made a mistake and are supposed to be forgiven and tell the truth  Yeah right   The thing is  there was even no need for this twist ending  I understand how subjective it may be  and you can fight tooth and nail claiming that “The ending is believable  its about being honest with yourself  etc ” But if the game really wanted to dive into depression  it couldve instead explored the very real situation of a person who appears to be happy and vibrant committing suicide  Instead we have a twist ending more because of “shock” than because of telling a good emotional story  ",2023-08-03,2023-08-11,False,72,4,0.703977227210998535,39,True,False,False

like to preface by saying  no matter how good this game was  b it still cannot excuse the creators treatment of backers months or years of complete radio silence as well as the composers allegations of physical and emotional abuse  b It might be convenient to say questionable people can still make good games  but you are still directly funding and supporting these people  Please think about this carefully before supporting this game  Although lucky for all of you  I dont think this game is very good anyway    bMy biggest issues with this gameb  Now I know theres a tendency to really focus RPG maker games around the story  but games should be still fun to play  To be blunt  Omoris gameplay is pretty standard at best  and a complete pain to play at worst  When it comes to combat and puzzles  this game really limped its way through  Centering the combat around mechanics based on emotion is a cool idea  but ultimately it does nothing to shake up the formula emotions change up hit rates  defense  and attack stats  but they dont change gameplay much at all  That being said  I personally enjoy the strategy involved with traditional RPG turn based combat  and there are some challenging enemies that are fun to defeat but these sorts of battles can easily found in dozens of other games  I think probably the most interesting usage of the combat mechanics is when Omori uses it to spoiler calm himself and realize the relative powerlessness of his perceived dangers spoiler  although these are more like cutscenes than giving the player any real agencyability to interact with the story  Where this game REALLY drags its feet is the puzzles   None of them require any thinking to complete  but they are extended with small mazes  dragged out simple tasks  unnecessary cutscenes  and overall  for such simple puzzles  they take way too long to complete  Im not even sure if these are even qualified to be called “puzzles” as much as they are pressing one switch at a time until you can traverse an area   The part time job minigames are also sorely wanting in imaginativeness and fun it really feels like the team didnt consider  is this activity fun As much as they asked  does this keep the player busy They bloat gameplay time in the worst way possible  which leads to another serious complaint there are so many moments that seem to pad the users gameplay time for no reason except potential comedic value and these drawn out jokes get old by the first hour  For example  characters will repeat words over and over again  holding your gameplay progression hostage  and while you desperately click through the completely asinine dialogue  inevitably you will accidentally initiate a conversation again  prompting more drawn out dialogue  Nearly every character you come across has a bit of unique dialogue  and often they are so drawn out and boring to read the humor often falls completely flat and it feels at times that the creator has injected nearly every NPC with “quirky ” off beat dialogue that feels repetitive and unnecessary   I think fun NPCs and funny dialogue can make RPGmaker games more fun to explore and can really bring their world to life  but in this case it feels as if it serves no purpose other than having a shallow  off beat aesthetic   bHeres what Omori does rightb  Omocat is obviously an extremely talented artist  Even though NPC dialogue can be extremely weak  each character design is brimming with personality and whimsy  The art is probably what I like most about it its just a shame that the writing and gameplay doesnt hold up  Even then  the art direction feels very much reminiscent of games popular in early 2010 with saccharine  cute characters contrasted with disturbing content see Dreaming Mary  Wadanohara  Yume Nikki  Earthbound  and too many others to count   its a tried and true formula  and perhaps it wouldve felt more fresh if it were released 5 years ago  In 2020  it feels derivative  However  the main characters  Kel  Hero  and Aubrey  are also extremely likable and charming  with a surprising amount of depth  spoiler especially their “real world” versions  spoiler The NPCs that have more attention and care put into them also really shine  with genuinely funny interactions and distinctive character designs  Also  Omori earns some well deserved praise for the unique worlds building  Dream vs  reality isnt a new concept by any means  yet  Omori manages to explore these worlds in a thoughtful way the setting feels rich with enough specificity that makes it feel unique and personal  I think it does a great job at keeping up tension and suspense by making the mood abruptly shift from playful and cute to frightening   The story had so many elements I liked about it  which made it so disappointing when I reached the ending  which felt rather disappointing  MAJOR SPOILERS  spoiler When it turns out you killed Mari  the game treats it in almost a blasé manner  Theres so little discussion about why and how it happened  why Basil got involved  It just kind of drops that realization on you  you defeat your guilt  and then the game ends  It felt almost insensitive how the game suggests that you either choose to overcome your guilt or not  because the game is so linear the endings are decided literally by a yes or no question  Do you want to continue or not It felt like the game was saying that you killed Mari  choose to get over it or have a bad ending  spoiler  One thing must be said about the “horror” aspect of this game while yes  there are creepy and unsettling moments  the more I played it  the less I felt like this could be classified as a psychological horror game   There are scary moments  but the game reiterates throughout its entirety that many if not all of Omoris fears are not real threats to him simply manifestations of his own anxieties and mental state  This became a story that wasnt as much horrific as it was tragic   If anything  the horror elements of it  that being the unsettling noises or creepy faces  can feel superficial  even ham fisted at times   For a horror game  Omori really pulls its punches because the scariest parts of it are readily established as imagined and ultimately manageable  I felt that the only truly scary moments were at the very end   All in all  I dont think Omori has anything groundbreaking when it comes to its gameplay  nor do I necessarily think the story is unique  However  when the writing is at its best  its surprisingly heartfelt and thoughtful  Its simply a shame that the writing is inconsistent  and that the game itself doesnt seem to live up to the vision  There are good moments  but ultimately you can find plenty of other indie games for the same price or lower with better writing  better gameplay  and without the questionable team behind it ",2020-12-27,2020-12-29,False,136,4,0.645555257797241211,12,False,True,False

off  I want to say that I did not support this game on Kickstarter or follow its development  I picked it up because I was interested in playing a short  scary  interesting game  Omori is NONE of those things  I only finished it because of sunk cost and desperation to see SOMETHING worth my while  I did not   First  the pacing  One of the early pieces of dialogue in this game is Waiting for something to happen This is the thesis of this game  Waiting    waiting    WAITING for SOMETHING to happen  Youre thrust into big  meandering  maze like areas with inane tasks to do and characters with nothing interesting to say  The narration and NPC dialogue is bland  long winded  and boring  Your party members bicker constantly in the most stereotypical way possible  They are so shallow and predictable you can guess everything they are going to say before they say it  Slogging through long levels  uninteresting puzzles  and vapid dialogue turns this game into a complete chore  I could not believe how many hours I was losing to this complete time sink   Every once in a while the game would remember that its supposed to be a psychological horror and would give the smallest scrap of something interesting happening  but it did such a poor job building dread that the cheap jump scares were more confusing than frightening  and once you realize that all the spooks cant hurt Omori  they stop being threatening  There are some interesting ideas such as the horror enemies requiring special actions to defeat eg  Calm Down but considering you cant progress unless you press the one working button  the battles that should be the scariest are mind numbingly linear and dont feel threatening at all   So the gameplay is garbage  but the writing is even worse  If I was supposed to sympathize with Omori  I wasnt getting it  Omori and his friends are so bland I couldnt believe it  Yes  in both the dream and real world  Aubrey had a touch of interest to her  but even her personality mainly boiled down to being the angry girl  The plot is very sloppy  rarely following its own internal logic and the characters responding extremely bizarrely to their circumstances   spoilerFor example  in the real world  Sunny ends a battle with Aubrey by STABBING HER WITH A KNIFE IN THE PARK  Aubrey  now wounded  is whisked away by her friends  I thought this was a clever choice of showing real world consequences for game logic  but this cleverness is completely spoiled by the fact that in that same battle Aubrey beats you with a NAIL BAT  This bat is later described as being MORE DANGEROUS than a steak knife  So Sunny stabbing her was    justified I guess To really make things more confusing  Kel says its a good thing Sunny brought the knife to stab Aubrey with  but then takes it away from Sunny because its dangerous  To whom The implication is that such a thing is dangerous to Sunny  but    he just    stabbed a girl You should be worried about yourself  kid  The dialogue is just about the same even if you guard and dont use the knife  Aubrey just leaves because she sees the knife and Kel takes it away anyway spoiler  spoilerThe other scene that had me baffled is in dealing with Basil  When Basil has his breakdown in the bathroom  you   as a player   cannot do anything for him  Basil begs Sunny to stay  but all you can do is walk out  There are NO options to go back for him or get him help  When he has his second breakdown  his friends decide to sleep over in his living room and eat cookies all night  they never do a wellness check on him or offer support  they decide to just wait it out WHY Who acts like this THEN   THEN When Sunny finally does confront him in the middle of the night  the answer to their problems is to beat the shit out of each other so both boys end up in the hospital  Somehow  this resolves their inner turmoil and guilt  Why thoughspoiler  Additionally  the message of the story felt so misplaced it made my head spin  spoilerThe message seems to be that even at your lowest you should depend on your friends because they will always support you  However  there are some problems with this that make this message unbelievable  First  Sunny is trying to overcome the guilt of accidentally killing his sister and then INTENTIONALLY covering it up as a suicide  The accidental killing I can accept  but stringing her up with a noose is so outrageous that its unbelievable  Second  Sunny hasnt spoken to his friends in three years  and the friendship they had as 12 year olds was so vapid and shallow that it didnt feel very meaningful at all  There was nothing that proved they had a strong friendship that could overcome MURDERING YOUR SISTER AND FRAMING HER DEATH AS A SUICIDE  In the dream world  Sunny defeats his guilt and convinces himself that his friends will be understanding of the truth  WILL THEY THOUGH All I could imagine is Aubrey losing her shit and sending him back to the hospital spoiler  Last but not least  the handling of depression  suicide  and anxiety are so hamfisted they felt distasteful and cheap  spoilerThe game forces you  repeatedly  to make Omori stab himself to progress  Dealing with Basil as I outlined above is like a 101 book on how NOT to treat someone whos suicidal  One of the endings has Sunny jumping off a roof  which then features several minutes of Sunny falling to the ground with the perky Oyasumi music BLASTING in the background  and it was so tone deaf and edgy that I was torn whether to laugh or shut the game off in disgust  Sunnys depression is never broached in any meaningful way  and his badly characterized friends are unrealistically supportive of this boy who disappeared from their lives for years spoiler  EDIT  This bad writing in this

been frothing at the mouth  half begging for OMOCAT to please just give them one more drop of content  other half demanding refunds on Twitter  Ive been waiting for this game  and I was very excited knowing that it was finally out  given how many times throughout the 2 3 years that I have been checking up on its progress   I learned about OMORI through OMOCATs merch line  and my friends who also like OMOCATs work about OMORIs Kickstarter  As some of you may have as well  I had very high hopes for this game For someone with such good taste in art  I assumed that OMOCAT would put together a passionate team  well seasoned in the RPG Maker field  and put together a game that would be unlike anything weve ever seen  It would put even Undertale to shame   So  I recently finished this game  Was OMORI everything I hoped it would be Well     ART      If the art was bad  I wouldnt even keep this game in my library  After all  its OMOCAT and co  The game being pretty should be a given And let me tell you  it is VERY pretty  In fact  its gorgeous  The colors are vibrant  the art style is full of life and character  and you bet your ass you could put just about everything you see there on a shirt   MUSIC        Musics decent  For the games 179 songs  not everything is a banger  but there are definitely a few memorable tracks that Ill definitely come back to  OMOCAT put OMORIs OST up on Youtube  Check out CHAOS ASSEMBLY and Worlds End Valentine   GAMEPLAY           The gameplay  Oh man  this gameplay  This  Gameplay  Is  TEDIOUS   This is the part of OMORI that actually pisses me off  I refuse to believe that for how long it took to develop this game  and how many delays it had to fix the bugs and get this game juuuust right  that nobody took the time to wonder if the 10 or so hours of playing the game are because theres a lot of content  or because every single thing in this game is designed to slow you down as much as it possibly can  Not a single thing was given thought to streamline   The combat in this game  Its not great   Its pretty standard RPG combat  with a few gimmicks tacked on top of it  that dont really make it any more innovative or fun  If anything  with these tacked on combat mechanics  I really wish that there was more predictability in fights  because actions yours and enemies happen in unclear order  and sometimes the enemy just RNGs into an action that completely burns down what youve been building into At that rate  its not even skill or clever thinking  youre just spamming items and kill them fast moves until you either get lucky  or the enemy wipes you out without any real recourse  Your best choice ends up forfeiting  changing your items and skills to suit the fight the best you can  so youre more resilient to the enemys abilities and the RNG to trigger them that could crap all over your day  I can think of a very specific boss fight  spoiler Sweetheart spoiler  where this was the most apparent   The dialogue progression in this game  Its terrible   You cant fast track through any of the dialogue  or any of the cutscenes  When you have to repeat parts  due to loading a save  or doing something that requires repetition e g  recycling  doing a sorting job  whatever  you have to sit through the entire thing  again  and again  until you finally get past it and save yourself from the hell that makes 1 minute of your time feel like 10   I fondly remember one time where I was in an elevator  and the elevator took a long time to reach the floor I wanted to  because it had a brief and pointless cutscene in the midst of it  In the elevator was a save point  but I had saved before I made the elevator go to the floor I wanted to  Well  so it happened to be  there was a boss fight at the top As I fought for the first time  I knew I was going to lose the fight without respeccing  didnt feel like waiting for myself to die which was going to take a while  because yknow  RNG and no way to forfeit quickly  restarted the game  loaded the save  and then waited that long ass elevator ride back up  When I reached the floor  I accidentally triggered the elevator again  and had to wait ANOTHER very long and excruciating 40 60 seconds for the elevator to go back down  and then for me to send it back up once more  Speaking of saving   The saving mechanic in this game  Its terrible   When you lose an eventual fight likely a boss fight  and you know you cant really win without respecing or getting consumables to help you out  you are forced to load a save  Everything that happened between your last save and your death Yeah  you have to do EVERYTHING all over again  In Undertale  if you lost a fight  and went back to the boss  they dont give you the same long monologue because the game knows youve already seen it  you just go straight into the fight  Nothing of the sort exists in this game  You load the save  and the same dialogue  the same cutscenes  the same mindnumbing process of holding down the key that makes the dialogue progress automatically while you wait the 5 minutes that feels like an eternity to get to the fight you wanted to progress in the story   God forbid if you forget to save for a good while because you decided to go exploring the world instead   Moments like these make me wish you at least had automatic checkpointing when you go to the next room  or a way to skip through dialogue MUCH faster  or  well  anything that makes the game go faster Knowing how painfully slow everything is  the game conditioned me to obsessively save as often as possible  and every time I go for longer than 10 minutes without saving  I get uneasy   As for everything else  Everything else feels pretty standard and familiar to other RPG Maker games that I have played  Nothing to write home about   STORY        The story is interesting  but I dont feel that it goes deep enough to make me really care about the characters  Side characters dont really get much love whatsoever  and the main characters  despite seeing them a lot  I dont really get enough out of them to where I care enough to dig deeper  The drama and the mystery  if anything  is what kept me interested just enough to keep going  However  because of its shortcomings  the ending to this game didnt really hit me as hard as other games did   And lets not forget the horror  Aside from being an adventure game  this is also a horror game  and the horror is done REALLY well  Im a bit of a pansy that gets spooked fairly easily  but I can always appreciate a game that instils a good dose of the fear of the unknown  and this game does a lot of it  without resorting very much to cheap jumpscare tactics   I have felt that this game hints at having various secrets that I should uncover  maybe alternative endings  but because of how much of a burden the gameplay proved to be  I do not have any intention to come back to do so  Even during a story moment  I knew I had missed a potentially crucial story piece that I wanted to check out  but knowing that the last save I have is right before many many minutes of dialogue and fights  I couldnt be asked to go through all that crap again to see what I had missed   FINAL       Overall  I have pretty mixed feelings on this game  For how many years it took to make it  I feel that while the game has every potential to be amazing  the neglected pieces drag the entire game down way more than they should have  It does draw inspiration from other games shoutouts to Yume Nikki but not enough to make the game the best it can be   Im voting this down  partially to give caution  partially to give visibility  If the things that I have described as unpleasant wont bother you  you might enjoy this more than I did  Not that I didnt enjoy it  but man  was I underwhelmed   610",2020-12-27,2020-12-27,False,110,12,0.566693007946014404,9,True,False,False

start to look at it more critically  particularly at its plot  it does not stand at all    Ill start off with non spoilers first   The unbelievable relationship between friends  They only ever had happy times  The game tries to convince you that the power of their friendship is strong but since they never have conflicts  how am I supposed to believe their friendship is strong  Connection to the protagonist  Silent protagonists work but within a friend group  Sunny main protagonist says nothing and contributes nothing  Everything he struggles with  he overcomes almost immediately  Nothing really motivating for you to root for him besides the game ending in spoiler self deletion spoiler if you dont  spoiler He doesnt even seem to show gratitude after his friends buy him a violin  spoiler  The headspace  It has no bearing to the overarching plot  Maybe just what characters the friends enjoy or do for leisure  but its nothing of note  Some people say that its meant to be a distraction you need to overcome  but being in the game  it causes the whole thing to be unnecessarily long and padded out with filler  Furthermore  despite it being a distraction as a means of escape  the player will need to spoiler stab themselvesspoiler  to wake up  why would Sunny need such a measure to leave He would want to stay   Mishandling of suicide and depression  This game does not handle the topic well and uses it for shock value and in a cheap plot twist  Sunny is thought to have depression but everything is mostly overcome very easily and hes able to leave the house just because  without any player effort needed  Sunny also never smiles  so for people who are looking at Sunny as a representation of depression  it just contributes to the misconception that you can never have a moment of happiness if you have depression   If youre on the fence and looking at bad reviews  I really cannot recommend this game  maybe you can still enjoy it on a surface level  but its not the masterpiece so many people make it out to be   Now into issues that require spoiling   The whole thing about spoiler Maris death spoiler This among fans even  is a common criticism  How did the police never realize it wasnt suicide Yes the parents could have been given that information and covered it  but its fan speculation  I dont think Omocats team actually gave it that much of a thought  Considering how poor the writing is overall  its more likely a plot hole  Also if the parents knew  why would only Basil and Sunny be the ones carrying the guilt Wouldnt Sunnys parents feel guilty over lying that its suicide and causing Hero and Aubrey such pain   Another thing about Maris death  is that its way too bizarre  I do not buy two kids carrying a body up the stairs  back down and then hanging it to a tree  The whole thing about hanging from the tree makes Basil and Sunny make them less empathic too  I really dont know why the game needed this plot twist that is so poorly written and hinders the game overall   The game doesnt know when to be subtle  An example of something too explicit is when Kel suddenly goes on a rant about Heros reaction to Maris death  It takes away from Hero himself being the one to say that or for you to notice it yourself  At that point  we hadnt even seen Hero in the real world yet so I couldnt really care  it felt like Kel was force feeding me exposition    Things happen that dont make sense  Like the truth album  why does Sunny have memories from Basils perspective And Kel getting mad over Sunny holding a knife while Aubrey is swinging a NAIL BAT   wE aLl mAkE mIsTaKeS  Idk about you but didnt shove my sister down the stairs and hang her body on a tree  Though I guess its still easy to forgive Sunny because Mari is a nothing character without a will of her own  Also  since the game is so vague  its unclear if Mari saying its her fault for being so strict on Sunny and he should forgive herself is her actual thoughts or Sunny hallucinating  Unless ghosts are really real which the game doesnt explain  its Sunny imagining as such  Who is Sunny to give himself that forgiveness Its not his to give   Morals  because of the Mari death plot twist  this isnt about dealing with depression  The moral at the end was that friendship can help you overcome guilt  or that you must shed your guilt  The first moral sounds like its okay to do bad things if you have friends and the other is badly touched upon  Running away so long  Sunny needed to accept what hes done  first  not immediately just shedding that guilt  He shouldnt be looking so happy in the ending   Better stories and why Omori lacks    In the anime Anohana  a group of friends experience loss  The friendship is more genuine  They fought  they didnt all have good times  The death was an accident as well  without a cover up so there was no need for any weird convulsions  Just purely about loss and its able to get you emotionally invested   In the game Detention spoilers for this game spoiler The main character overcomes guilt in this game  Nobody says to forgive herself  She did something terrible  It will not change  But she must face it  Omori falls short by saying you need to forgive yourself and that its okay you just made a mistake  spoiler  Omori is able to fool and emotionally manipulate most players by its music  aesthetics and art  maybe Basil with a flower crown is cute  maybe the friendship seems so wholesome but once you strip away the pretty looks  theres nothing there  Maybe it can still be enjoyable  but its no

whole time and I couldnt wait to see what would happen next  Unfortunately the hype is builds up to is a complete letdown  All spoilers will be marked  so no worries about accidentally getting them here  If you think youll like this game  play it yourself before spoilering yourself  It works for a lot of people somehow  but not me   The combat in this game is super fun and unique  The game uses emotions with special effects that makes for a lot of different strategies  That being said  the game super easy and I didnt know it was even possible to get a game over until super late into it  It would be better if bosses or enemies used emotions more that you had to play around  or used more extreme emotions  It needed some fine tuning with battles  Theres a lot of cool battles in only the bad route that feel like strategies used shouldve been there the whole time  Also some final items are just    not as good as regular ones you pick up  Specifically  Kel using chicken ball with run and gun is broken  he doesnt need his basketball  Also using items in this game is straight broken  the game is easy enough without them  once you start using them every battle is baby  nonthreatening  and anticlimactic since theres no tension  I wish there was a hard mode option like Bug Fables that you can toggle  where battles are more difficult but you get more exp or money for it    Also  telling you now  the bad route isnt worth it  That extra content was fun  but it shouldve been in the base route  Also that Boss Rush unlocked in the bad route is the babiest  lamest Boss Rush Ive ever played  It only uses mandatory bosses  which means youll be fighting 10 bosses instead of the literal 40 that are in the game  Such a let down    Also  people compliment the music in this game a lot Listen  its catchy  I like it  but it sounds noisy  Sounds overlap with each other constantly to make a ear grating  overwhelming noise  Theres also no build at all  Same thing over and over  theres no flow  I think it really shows how inexperienced the composer for this is because whenever there IS a buildup  they break it into two separate songs on the OST   Again  no flow  Basically  music is fine but not even close masterpiece level    Listen  I was ready to replay this game  achievement hunt  and do all routes but    that ending is a deal breaker for me personally  I was neutral about it at first but the more I thought about it the more it soured the entire game for me  I had fun until I finished it  It just leaves a really bad taste in my mouth  The twist of the game muddies the entire message and makes the characters extremely unrelatable in any way  which I dont think the message was going for  I think it really needed to be rewritten so the story can be relatable to people  The heavy themes in this story are important to many people  either directly or through someone they know  but the game ends up throwing all of this out for a  quite frankly  edgy and completely unrealistic twist that a player cant connect with at all   Basically this game couldve been so good if the ending was reworked  It needs a LOT of work  Ive seen ideas floating around on how to improve it and I like those much better  I cannot fathom how people see this ending as a masterpiece and find themselves relating to it   Spoilers below explaining why the ending is so bad to me  so if you think this is something youll like  play first and see for yourself   spoiler This game asks you to sympathize with a straight up criminal  I couldnt take ANY of the ending seriously  because I kept thinking  Sunny and Basil should be in fucking prison  If you dont know the story  you know all those trigger warnings at the beginning Warning you about suicide Yeah  theres NONE of that if you play it right  And you most likely will  Getting the true ending WITH bonus content is almost a guaranteed  No one will kill themself  The one person you THOUGHT killed herself  didnt Sunny accidentally kills his sister by pushing her down the stairs  THEN FRAMES IT AS SUICIDE WITH BASIL  They are 12  What the actual fuck  How the hell am I supposed to feel bad for them I can believe Sunny accidentally killed his sister  but framing it as suicide it beyond fucked up  I dont understand how people see themselves in these characters  The message is that Sunny is depressed because he killed his sister but learns to forgive himself And the game implies at the end that his friends will as well Which I do not buy at all  Another issue is Basil is such a non character  Hes toxic and whiny  The game tells you over and over that him and Sunny are best friends11 But they never show it  Basil is simply there to take most the blame so that you can feel worse for Sunny  This game also uses suicide only as a plot device This game is NOT a good representation of mental illness  The games goes get the good ending  if you dont these boys will kill themselves  Isnt that so sad Feel bad for them  Get the good ending  Also Sunny doesnt feel traumatized due to literally being the exact same before and after his sisters death  Hes always deadpan  He wasnt lively before she died  and he isnt after  Theres no change  Also making Maris suicide actually be murder is so lackluster  Like  shes a happy go lucky person  Realistically  a lot of people like her are actually suffering so I can see her committing suicide  Think Sayori from DDLC  But no  she was actually perfect this whole time  Shes also a perfect victim  She loves Sunny and would forgive him for killing her  which makes Sunny seem more in the right and innocent  What a poor sad boy Sunny is spoiler",2022-01-04,2022-03-21,False,5,1,0.542437076568603516,0,True,False,False

Let me preface this by saying that this game is extremely well crafted  Its visuals  the soundtrack  the sound design show extreme attention to detail  some jokes are funny  the game is clearly a work of love and  overall  is very enjoyable    for a player with the right expectations   Some of the reviews compared this game favorably with iThe Stanley Parablei which I love andor classic point and click adventure games which I love even more  so my hopes were high  I expected this to be a thought provoking  elaborate commentary on game design or at least have some challenging and mind bending puzzles  The game didnt deliver on either of these fronts   h1Gameplayh1  As opposed to iThe Stanley Parablei  the game is completely linear and consists of a series of puzzles  Though they resemble the ones from the classic point and click games in spirit that is  employ the infamous moon logic  in practice they are somewhat less varied and much  much easier due to the narrator more or less telling you the solution outright and then acting surprised that it worked  but more on that later   Some reviews claim that this game makes one think outside the boxwell  this is only true for the players that didnt play enough adventure games by LucasArts to find it completely natural that  say  a photo of a thing can be used in place of that thing  Once you grasp the moon logic employed here  it is all simple and not at all mind bending in the way that a challenging puzzle game like iBaba is Youi is  where the understanding of the rules builds on itself to make the player once and again achieve the seemingly impossible  It is telling that there are some levels in Baba is You that took me twice as long to beat as this whole game without ever using the hint system   The developer is clearly closely familiar with the classic point and click games  which shows in form of some clever references to them  A more subtle sign is that several puzzles are on par with the best of the genre  They would be fun to solve  but the developer probably thought that just expecting the player to figure the logic out on their own would cause too many to become stuck and frustrated  so there is no option to make the narrator stop spoiling the solutions instantly   h1Story and themesh1  Even though the game wears its meta themes on its sleeve see the provocative name There is no game  the treatement it gives them is shallow  The discussion of the meta matters is more or less limited to the narrator constantly screaming that its not a game and urging you to quit which  judging by the amount of positive reviews that focus on this  is entertaining  taking jabs at the free2play model  joking about the playable characters being unable to do anything on their own  and all that   What did I expect instead Well  a game whose antagonist is literally the concept of game glitches could explore the nuanced way in which glitches may somehow enhance the gameplay instead of hindering it  Instead  the glitch is cartoonishly evil  tries to take over the world  hates the game and tries to hinder its progress  A game where the moon logic is often imentionedi could also idiscussi it  for example  analyzing the state of mind in which it makes sense   For comparison  The Stanley Parable is dedicated to thoroughly exploring the concept of immersion by giving us the role of an office worker who lost his work immersion  then in the simple route immersing us in the story  and last  breaking the immersion with a seemingly absurd ending and discussing this  Other routes expect us to disobey the narrator and thus discover the fragile contract between the player expecting to be immersed and the game promising that immersion in return for obeying its rules  The question of the escapism inherent to the immersion is also given a solid treatment  but hey  this review is not for iThe Stanley Parablei  so lets stop here   The plot of iThere is no gamei is nonsensical and  it seems  only exists to give some incentive to go from puzzle to puzzle  Thinking too hard about the story makes it fall apart miserably  I wont even bother putting this general outline under a spoiler  were accompanied by a sentient game thats an RPG which is strange  given that it criticizes some RPG conventions during the plot  but lets go with that that was cancelled because its gameplay was cut out to be incorporated in another program uhh    didnt the creator know that the code can also be copied and not just moved  which caused a glitch bent on conquering the world to appear instead not in the form of some clever allusion  instead  this is just a ridiculous plot device  and our global goal is to reunite the game with its gameplay  with a cheap love story going on between the two  The game that accompanies us is inconsistent about whether its a cancelled RPG in story or the actual game were playing iThere is no gamei  on the one hand  it begs us not to ask for a refund and also controls our progress  and on the other  it gets confused about the quest elements  pretending that the player subverts its expectations and breaks the gameplay by employing the moon logic    even though the game actually more or less tells you the solution if the player takes more than a minute solving the puzzle  clearly having known the answer beforehand   All of this is entertaining in a good sensethe drama  though forced  is well presented  and the interactions between the characters are well writtenbut does not give any food for thought and actually relies on the player not bothering to think about the general picture   h1Verdicth1  I rarely write reviews and usually dont put much effort into it  but here I was extremely disappointed and thought that I owed it to the community to leave a thorough review  The game is good  fun and well built  but this is no iThe Stanley Parablei and is entirely skippable  Maybe buy the soundtrack separately instead   Also  to the question of skipping  I couldnt find out how to do that to cutscenes  so farming achievement became a big chore ",2021-01-03,2021-01-03,False,15,0,0.480318933725357056,2,True,False,False

chance to defend my position   First of all  I admit  that on surface this game isnt bad at all   graphics  sounds  scenario  UI  and of course  all those pop culture references are all greatly done and fit perfectly  And I even can say  that if youre a person who never played Tower Defense game before and want to try something out   this is an relatively alright game to start with  At least to see whats the genre is vaguely about   So whats my problem with this game and why I would not recommend it to anyone whos actually familiar with genre Quick answer   core gameplay  Now to elaborate  First of all  you cannot really choose where to put your towers  There are very few prepared slots  and its quite obvious  where you should create defenses  As I said before  only if youre completely new to the genre it may present any sort of challenge for you  For comparison  most game have big grids where you can possibly put your defenses   and you have relative freedom  Next point   for almost half of the campaign you are actually very limited with what towers you can put and which of them you can upgrade   basically  that part of the game is a prolonged tutorial  and its absolutely clear  which towers you better use at those stages   since game introduces those towers at the exactly right time for you  Third point   heroes  It may be somewhat subjective  I admit  but in my understanding  the point of Tower Defense games is to create a base  that is capable of self defending  without my direct actions   otherwise game turns into or becomes significantly closer to RTS  or something between RTS and RPG  like Warcraft 3  for example  Basically  hero mechanic in TD game means  that you have another thing to keep an eye on  while at the same time game provide you means of patching up holes in defense  when you did not think strategically or was not aware of what enemies may come your way  Which brings us to 4th point   enemy spawns  Game clearly was created in a way  so you could finish every stage on first try   at least on normal difficulty  You have plenty of gold to spare  and  naturally  Hero will help you to survive even if you made few mistakes  But at the same time  you can see enemies only half wave ahead   only when next wave already approaching  And even then you can only see their numbers  sometimes not even realizing what those new enemies are and what danger they may represent  Can you see how this goes against any sort of tactical and strategic thinking And in the end  it goes against the whole point of TD genre Instead of carefully planning your defense  thinking how to better spend your resources and where to put your towers   and which towers to actually put where   all you do is reacting to random waves  that you cannot even really predict   and you can only hope  that  for example  creating 2 anti air towers will be enough  and next wave wont have 4x air units  or you wont need 3 extra troop towers for some particular route  because fast enemies will go exactly there  Thats why more competent games often have lists of enemies at least 3 5 waves ahead  sometimes the entire stage is listed before it starts  so you can prepare  At the very least enemy types could be listed  But here   nah  who cares  And ok  you may think   well  they compensated one thing with another  its just a different kind of game  made for casuals  how is this bad  And I would agree   except there are challenge modes  that either allow only specific towers  or not allow to use heroes  So   that removes my 2nd and 3rd points  right I can play game in different way  right Wrong  because for that challenge to open I have to complete this level first anyway   so that challenge mode is just a little bonus  But thats not even the big problem  Big problem is   those challenge modes have completely different waves  So you cannot learn those waves while completing that map for the first time   then go in with less resources and tactically plan everything  no no no  That would be too much tactical thinking for this game Instead you must go in blind   seeing only half wave ahead again  and since challenge is real now  you will most likely lose 1 3 or even 5 times  simply because you dont know what comes next and you cannot adequately prepare  So while game is trivial at first  it becomes tedious at the end  making you lose repeatedly and not giving you enough information to win  so you have to act by trial end error  And that trial and error way of thinking is my last point   you have no way of predicting how anything will affect anything until you try it  Can you tell how much damage will level 3 archers will make against medium armor enemy Of course not  you have no idea how much medium is   and looking up Archers tower damage will only waste your time  Same thing with every possible numeric stat   you cannot count anything in this game  you can only feel that something should work   and whether or not it will  depends on some hidden parameters that you know nothing about  There is actually more to say  for example about spellstowers upgrades that you assign at the world map  spells themselves  that act in same way as Hero   making you patching holes more than planning defense  and there is arguable point that in this game there are no really different ways of winning  you have to move in narrow corridor of whats available to you   creating all types of towers to be comfortable  instead of creating unique interesting tactics for different maps   but I realize  that my review is way too long as it is   So in the end  this game is spitting on the whole idea of Tactical and Strategic thinking   and on Tower Defense Genre overall  putting cute graphics  UI and sounds above everything reminds me of certain modern movies actually  If you are true fan of the genre   please  play something else  there are plenty of games that may not look this fancy  but have a lot more to offer in terms of actual gameplay ",2020-07-24,2020-07-24,False,7,0,0.475037246942520142,17,True,False,False

spoil anything so Ill keep it VERY simple  The game starts lighthearted without much direction and some funny jokes and banter  Eventually a serious plot springs up out of nowhere  but the game tries to keep the lighthearted feel at parts  It honestly feels like the devs didnt have any plans  realized they needed something  and rushed a main plot while haphazardly filling any hole they left  That said  my standards for story are usually pretty high  so if you like what you hear from other reviews then dont be afraid to buy the game for the story  The characters were well written  especially Simmer  Grill  and the skeleton crew  I could see them carrying the story for someone who thinks theyd enjoy it  Sadly wasnt enough for me though   b Gameplay b Honestly the biggest reason I cant recommend the game  As mentioned above  I played on the hardest difficulty  so that without a doubt played a part in my experience  The best part of the game is the combos of food and weapons  Its fun to mix and match things and see what works  Not only that  but you have a good spread of different weapons and food that can give you completely different play styles   Thats sadly where the positives end  The fights and areas between the bosses are pointless  Theyre not challenging or fun  even on the hardest difficulty  All the enemies in these areas can be killed nearly instantly  and I had no trouble tanking through literally every platforming part  Remember  this is on the HIGHEST DIFFICULTY  I honestly dont even know if I should complain though  because the movement can be sorta jank at times  You get a number of mobility abilities later in the game  like dashes  extra jumps  and the ability to climb walls  Sounds fun until you realize that the movement isnt very smooth  There were times I dashed and still got hit  or other times I tried to use my second or third jump  only to not have it work   The bosses can range from being insanely easy to annoyingly unfair  Every boss can have their health shredded immediately  only for them to go into an invulnerable bullet hell phase for some reason  Now  I like bullet hells  but you need good movement to make them work  Remember the movement problems I mentioned before Now add in some unfair patterns that cant be dodged if the boss decides to stand in a bad spot  Suddenly you have a horribly obnoxious fight where youre replaying the same boss  waiting one to two minutes to get to the second bullet hell phase  only to die from something that isnt your fault and have to do it again a number of times  The game is best at the beginning  and as you progress the chapters it honestly gets worse  The final boss is a joke  but the bosses before it are way too difficult  mainly due to the annoying RNG bullet hell parts and clunky mobility I talked about   b Pet Peeves b Just some minor pet peeves here  They dont matter enough to affect the gameplay or story  but still annoy me a little  Feel free to ignore them or read them  They honestly shouldnt change whether youd buy the game or not   To start  the achievements are broken  I got and made all the recipes in the game  Theres an achievement for that  and I got it  Theres another achievement for making the FIRST meal you can make  I dont have this achievement  Why dont I have this achievement I dont know  I made the first meal  I have the achievement for making all the food in the game  which only 4 of people have  But I dont have the one for making the first meal  which is required to progress in the game  80 of people have it  but I dont  Not only that  I beat the third chapter on executive chef difficulty  but I didnt get the achievement for that  Sorta annoying not to get it after putting all that effort into it   Insight points  You get them from killing enemies and reading dialogue  Theyre used to make meals and weapons  as well as upgrading meals later on  Theyre pointless in the first half of the game  you always have too much  The dev clearly put them into the game as a currency for making things  realized they had no purpose  and tossed in upgrading to make them useful  Now  that doesnt bother me  What bothers me is that they still required insight points to craft things  Its annoying to spend all your points on upgrading a dish you already have  only for you to not be able to craft the new dishesweapons you just got because they need 2k insight  Honestly not a huge problem  it just sucks to not have enough insight and skip a dish for the current area  only to have it immediately one upped by another in the next   Minor typos in the text  especially in the last chapters  Nothing big or worth complaining about  but they are there   b Summary b Game isnt bad  but I personally wasnt a massive fan  Be sure to read through some other positive and negative reviews  especially one that played a lower difficulty  to see if youd enjoy it  If you think youd like the story you might want to consider buying  but DO NOT buy it just for the gameplay  Theres tons of similar games with better gameplay  and if you wont like the story youll probably dislike the game like me   Id recommend buying the game when its on sale  preferably for less than 9 99  I dont think the game is worth 20  but Id be fine with what I got out of it if I paid less than ten bucks

chef using a spear and shield combo for most of the game  Be aware that this likely affected my view on the gameplay to a degree   The game has some ups and downs  Ill start with the best and move towards the worst   b Art b In my opinion  the arts honestly the best part of the game  The characters that come up during dialogue look great  and the enemies and environments are well made  Its clear that the devs put some time into making everything look good  There wasnt any time I was annoyed or disappointed by the visuals  b Story b Wasnt bad  but I honestly wasnt a fan  I dont want to spoil anything so Ill keep it VERY simple  The game starts lighthearted without much direction and some funny jokes and banter  Eventually a serious plot springs up out of nowhere  but the game tries to keep the lighthearted feel at parts  It honestly feels like the devs didnt have any plans  realized they needed something  and rushed a main plot while haphazardly filling any hole they left  That said  my standards for story are usually pretty high  so if you like what you hear from other reviews then dont be afraid to buy the game for the story  The characters were well written  especially Simmer  Grill  and the skeleton crew  I could see them carrying the story for someone who thinks theyd enjoy it  Sadly wasnt enough for me though   b Gameplay b Honestly the biggest reason I cant recommend the game  As mentioned above  I played on the hardest difficulty  so that without a doubt played a part in my experience  The best part of the game is the combos of food and weapons  Its fun to mix and match things and see what works  Not only that  but you have a good spread of different weapons and food that can give you completely different play styles   Thats sadly where the positives end  The fights and areas between the bosses are pointless  Theyre not challenging or fun  even on the hardest difficulty  All the enemies in these areas can be killed nearly instantly  and I had no trouble tanking through literally every platforming part  Remember  this is on the HIGHEST DIFFICULTY  I honestly dont even know if I should complain though  because the movement can be sorta jank at times  You get a number of mobility abilities later in the game  like dashes  extra jumps  and the ability to climb walls  Sounds fun until you realize that the movement isnt very smooth  There were times I dashed and still got hit  or other times I tried to use my second or third jump  only to not have it work   The bosses can range from being insanely easy to annoyingly unfair  Every boss can have their health shredded immediately  only for them to go into an invulnerable bullet hell phase for some reason  Now  I like bullet hells  but you need good movement to make them work  Remember the movement problems I mentioned before Now add in some unfair patterns that cant be dodged if the boss decides to stand in a bad spot  Suddenly you have a horribly obnoxious fight where youre replaying the same boss  waiting one to two minutes to get to the second bullet hell phase  only to die from something that isnt your fault and have to do it again a number of times  The game is best at the beginning  and as you progress the chapters it honestly gets worse  The final boss is a joke  but the bosses before it are way too difficult  mainly due to the annoying RNG bullet hell parts and clunky mobility I talked about   b Pet Peeves b Just some minor pet peeves here  They dont matter enough to affect the gameplay or story  but still annoy me a little  Feel free to ignore them or read them  They honestly shouldnt change whether youd buy the game or not   To start  the achievements are broken  I got and made all the recipes in the game  Theres an achievement for that  and I got it  Theres another achievement for making the FIRST meal you can make  I dont have this achievement  Why dont I have this achievement I dont know  I made the first meal  I have the achievement for making all the food in the game  which only 4 of people have  But I dont have the one for making the first meal  which is required to progress in the game  80 of people have it  but I dont  Not only that  I beat the third chapter on executive chef difficulty  but I didnt get the achievement for that  Sorta annoying not to get it after putting all that effort into it   Insight points  You get them from killing enemies and reading dialogue  Theyre used to make meals and weapons  as well as upgrading meals later on  Theyre pointless in the first half of the game  you always have too much  The dev clearly put them into the game as a currency for making things  realized they had no purpose  and tossed in upgrading to make them useful  Now  that doesnt bother me  What bothers me is that they still required insight points to craft things  Its annoying to spend all your points on upgrading a dish you already have  only for you to not be able to craft the new dishesweapons you just got because they need 2k insight  Honestly not a huge problem  it just sucks to not have enough insight and skip a dish for the current area  only to have it immediately one upped by another in the next   Minor typos in the text  especially in the last chapters  Nothing big or worth complaining about  but they are there   b Summary b Game isnt bad  but I personally wasnt a massive fan  Be sure to read through some other positive and negative reviews  especially one that played a lower difficulty  to see if youd enjoy it  If you think youd like the story you might want to consider buying  but DO NOT buy it just for the gameplay  Theres tons of similar games with better gameplay  and if you wont like the story youll probably dislike the game like me   Id recommend buying the game when its on sale  preferably for less than 9 99  I dont think the game is worth 20  but Id be fine with what I got out of it if I paid less than ten bucks

well   Id highly recommend Bug Fables to people who really like JRPG staples  a lot of characters to talk to  lots of dialogue  long stories about an adventurer party  preparing a bunch of items before setting out  loads of sidequests  etc  Unfortunately  it has enough shortcomings in gameplay that its annoying for people who are less JRPG inclined  Since I lean toward the latter  I ended up with a Not Recommended review  Onto my gameplay grievances   The mana system Flower Points in Paper Mario  TP here is designed in an outdated  bad way  Skills  abilities  and magic are what make RPGs fun  Well  old games with outdated design philosophies make you wait a long time to recharge your ability resource  MMOs  JRPGs  Dungeons and Dragons  they all made it a chore to regenerate these fun points  Modern game devs know thats stupid  because the player wont even feel good about using cool abilities  because they know that expenditure just cost them in time  ingame currency  or whatever   The solution is to create higher effort  more intricate and interwoven resource systems  where your boring  resource free basic attacks somehow contribute to building up your mana  Bug Fables doesnt do this  Before getting some of the endgame medals  you have no way to replenish TP without spending currency  of which you dont get very much  For most of the game  you spend the majority of your time in combat using boring basic attacks over and over  instead of the cool skills with effects that add strategic depth  You unlock new abilities  and then rarely use them  because you run out of food that restores TP   That leads me to the cooking system  Its bad  You cant make food in bulk  so you have to laboriously hand the chef one ingredient at a time  and then wait through the cooking animation every time  Its such a chore that this is one of the only games where Ive considered the time cost of resupplying  There are FAR too many recipes 70  most of which youll never want to use  To assemble the ingredients to make food you want  you have to walk around for minutes  visiting various ingredient vendors across the world  And walking is slow  Early on  before metal island  money is tight  too  You end up really REALLY not wanting to waste mana  because cooking sucks   And the game is eager to make you cook  because its stingy about letting you heal for free  You have to walk to inns which you have no choice but to pay for  until later or farm money to make more food  Occasionally  you encounter a save point that restores your HP and TP for free  Well  if you return to that save point a little later  it no longer heals you  All it does is save  So go spend 3 minutes running to an inn to pay to play  or run around the world making more food   This creates a problem where too much of the game is just you walking around slowly  from point A to point M  and back to point A  just so you can resume what you were doing before  This happens when you need to cook going elsewhere to buy ingredients so you can return to the chef  when you need to heal going elsewhere to pay for healing  then returning  and in the many  many sidequestsrunning around is implicit in sidequests  And unlike in Paper Mario  you have no spin to move faster and pretend youre playing a game  rather than a walking simulator   Levelups dont feel very good  I was happier about the full HP and TP restore because of the aforementioned problem of having to pay to heal  The best levelup reward to take is obviously the medal point increase  but because of how you dont get fun or powerful medals until late in the game  you dont get much stronger early on  The devs know which medals are fun  sought after  and effective  So they buried them away into the last parts of the game  For the first half  youre stuck putting on silly situational medals whose effects are rarely active   Combining all these problems leads to one big issue  Bug Fables makes you wait a long time  or jump through a lot of hoops  before it lets you have fun  Even the early puzzles are too simple  for too long   All of that said  the game is charming  I can see why people love the story and characters  even though I dont like them as much  Some parts are really well done  but most of the story isnt  The character specific sidequests well  Kabbus is more of a main quest are the highlights of the games story  Theres one per main character  and theyre all great  because they present story arcs that are fundamental to each characters personality  Theyre excellently done  with good writing and characterization  One in particular has an optional dungeon thats the best in the game  in terms of presentation  worldbuilding  story  and atmosphere  Where most of the dungeons and chapter end bosses in Bug Fables dont say much about the world at all  this dungeon does it all correctly  The other dungeon end bosses are just I am the guardian of this place I will fight you  Oh I am defeated  Whatever   The combat gets a lot better toward the end  giving you options that are actually interesting as you start unlocking medals that let you regain TP and do interesting things with the combat mechanics  That still doesnt excuse the first 70 being such a chore   The music is amazing  and Bug Fables is still better than most of its even more flawed competition  Great game for fans of JRPGs who have calluses built up against these negatives  Slow  meandering journey for everyone else ",2020-01-05,2020-01-05,False,89,9,0.620929718017578125,0,True,False,False

as much as it was plowing through an increasingly frustrating game to get to the end out of sheer stubbornness which I am    The good  The combat  for one   all three party members have different specializations and great synergy  theres a lot you can do with the medal system to really build some interesting teams and strategies  enemies are pretty diverse and usually pretty fair  The lore   lots of thought put into this  both in overt and subtle ways  though I wish more of it came to the forefront instead of being buried in optional collectibles  The art   everything looks good  very colorful and consistent style  The music   completely good in every aspect though I dont know how much of it will be memorable for me in the long term  The main characters   all three developed well  feel very distinct  have interesting backstories  interact well together  etc  and there are a few other non protagonists who get a lot of attention for the better  And now  to probably look like Im contradicting myself  The bad  The combat   Okay but this gets reeeally stale by the later chapters when enemies get tankier and tankier despite your base damage almost never increasing throughout the game  youre given more sources of TP and regen medals to balance it out but it still ends up feeling exhausting by the end  especially in the last chapter where you simply cant use bug me not to skip enemy encounters even when youve reached max level  The setting   while the game for the most part looks good  and the lore itself is good    theres not much else beyond that thats very intriguing  Theres like    two or three visually interesting areas in the entire game  with the rest basically being retreads of the most generic locations possible   get used to grasslands  all Im saying   and exploring these areas just doesnt feel special  The characters   beyond the main characters and the few notable side characters    I cant tell you how many characters felt interchangeable with each other  in no small part because a lot of the NPC bug designs look really similar  which is a shame when there clearly was an effort to make most of them unique  and yet it doesnt really amount to much when theres only a handful of minor NPCs I can even remember  since you just dont do a ton of interacting with most of them  Also  the villain has an interesting backstory I suppose but is really boring and unmemorable as a presence in the game The worldexploration   ooooh but this is the big one  The game seems really  really proud of its ice block puzzles  for one  which get old by    chapter 2  at the latest  and a lot of the overworld traversal mechanics are    intentionally slow  on top of that  Slowly pushing blocks A very touchy boomerang mechanic that you can angle in 360 directions and probably shouldnt be able to Dropping ice into water one small step at a time Flying but incredibly slowly Using a shield but incredibly slowly The game does well to make backtracking less of an issue but there are still places you need to revisit for quests and the like that make you redo the platforming andor puzzles just to get back  Chapter 7 is especially egregious about this in general its the worst chapter in basically every aspect  honestly  aside from its setting  but  This part became the biggest chore by the endgame  and the actually clever puzzles were far and few between   and theres just  no good platforming period since this game isnt designed for it  Eehhh  Recipes   well these are in theory fine but the game never gives you enough push to experiment with them since most items can just be bought and after a point getting berries is not difficult to do   I have over 2k in the bank by the time I completed everything  so  And  also  in general   I dont think the game does enough to differentiate itself from its obvious inspirations  It does iterate on the paper mario formula a little  though a lot of these felt like QoL updates   retrying bosses on death  fast travel  small stuff like that   and the only major changes besides are the three character combat system  which is definitely one of the untouchably good aspects of the game  I really dont think this is overall a bad game but I just had a combination of not really ever feeling too engaged by the games world or story on top of a ton of frustration and tedium with the actual gameplay itself  Im sure if I went back to TTYD replay today Id probably find some of the same problems  sure  but    I feel like that game manages to keep itself constantly fresh in a way this one just doesnt for me  Id give a meh rating if steam allowed it  but I cant say Im coming away from this one with a positive feeling other than relief that Im finally done with it

little more TLC  Evoking the iPaper Marioi RPG series  the game nearly hits every element on the mark  engaging combat  lighthearted art style  and a medal based system that helps build your characters however you want  Despite this  however  iBug Fablesi falls flat on the execution   Set in the whimsical and tiny land of Bugaria  iBug Fablesi tells the  well  ifablesi of a group of unlikely pals  the chivalrous beetle Kabbu  the feisty bee Vi  and the mysterious moth Leif  Banded together on a quest from the queen  their journey takes them all across the land full of treacherous pitfalls and fiendish foes Along the way theyll meet an array of colorful characters while taking on sidequests to grow more powerful on their journey  The storys nothing to write home about  of course  but the characters are memorable and watching the teams awkward partnership grow into genuine friendship is worth the ride   Naturally  of course  you didnt read this review to hear about the story  Like the series it attempts to emulate  iBug Fablesi employs a somewhat unique RPG system in which combat is performed through a series of simple and engaging actions rather than just pressing A  Whether that includes button mashing  inputting a quick series of commands  or simply aiming a crosshair depends on the character  besides being rather different in personality  each party member has their strengths and weaknesses  something the game makes painfully clear once it gets started    Outside of combat youll be collecting bBadgesb  helpful trinkets that augment the power of your characters in a myriad of ways  One  for example  might make every attack you perform replenish some health at the expense of attack power  Another might give the wearer extra defense provided theyre ipoisonedi  Thankfully not all of these medals are as gimmicky as I described  but with this system comes one of my biggest issues with the game  ithe sense of progressioni   In the original iPaper Marioi  there was only one character making use of badges  the mustachioed murder machine himself  Your partners shared FP  the points used for skills  but they never required badges themselves  In iBug Fables i many badges are applied to one character  meaning if you want to equip  say  an HP Medal  youll have to choose which party member needs it the most and hope that the others will be okay  Given that the game likes to have you swap out characters to perform contextual moves on the field  it can be frustrating when one of your weaker characters enters a battle and takes all of the hits  Granted  you can shift party order in a battle  but by then youve already wasted a turn  The solution  then  is to find better medals  but some of them dont appear until much later in the game and the ones that idoi always seem to have some kind of tradeoff with defensive or offensive power   Which leads me to my second gripe  unless you equip a certain badge that immediately kills enemies that are weaker than you  you never truly feel istrongeri in iBug Fablesi  Sure  you unlock better moves and have a choice of upgrading HP  SP  or Badge Points with each level  but even then youre fettered to using special moves in every fight even against weaker foes  so after 2 or 3 battles youll be completely drained of the ability to do anything save for basic attacks  Again  this can be navigated somewhat by collecting the right badges  but with some of them not appearing until later on in the game  youll find yourself scraping by well into the middle of the story even after completing every available sidequest leading up to that point   So where does that leave us The first option is to specialize  Without the ability to respec until later on  your best bet for survival is to choose a certain line of level up bonuses until enough badges present themselves  and then its just a frantic rush to dump as much levels into BP as you can before the game ends  Easy as this is  its a far cry from the source material where you could employ several strategies in completing the game  be it a more traditional HPFP build or the infamous Danger Mario  Despite marketing it as an all ages RPG  iPaper Marioi had a lot going for it  iBug Fablesi  on the other hand  sometimes gives me the impression that it could have been tested out a bit more   One of the ways Mario navigated the pitfalls iBug Fablesi tumbles into was by giving Mario equipment upgrades  though it didnt happen every chapter  upgrading from the regular hammer to the Ultra Hammer  for example  made you feel like you were improving  Mario gained a new move  could destroy more obstacles  and did more damage with basic attacks  Even party members could be upgraded with special stones  and by the end of the game if you revisit previous areas youll find yourself stomping through them like Godzilla in an orphanage  iBug Fablesi  however  has no such balance to my knowledge  I played to the end of Chapter 4  Therefore your two sources of attack power come from either Skills  which will drain all of your SP away in a matter of battles when youve got 3 teammates using them up  or Badges  which again usually offer a trade off such as Defense Down  But Attack Up  Its a system that works in the beginning of the game  but about halfway through it gets pretty tiresome  especially when the enemies dont get any easier   In conclusion  I really wanted to enjoy iBug Fables i but after 13 hours of playtime I cant find myself recommending it  Theres a whole bunch of cool concepts in this game  but iPaper Mariois a tough act to follow  and with shaky game mechanics and other minor annoyances such as Healing Points arbitrarily disappearing and half of the items punishing your team with crippling side effects  the game feels like more of a chore to finish than anything else  Maybe some day when Im bored Ill finish it up  but if youre still on the fence about whether to get it or not  Id wait for a sale

Comments are enabled there i  This is a love letter to the iPaper Marioi series  It has the same papercraft art style and gameplay centered around action commands  but offers several new ideas of its own  such as a setting full of adorable bug people and non silent protagonists  Unfortunately  it doesnt live up to the hype  On its own merits  its… okay But it does not live up to its inspiration  I liked some of the gameplay changes but disliked others  and the writing is a mess   Gameplay first  There are several things I liked  You have a party of three instead of two  allowing for more complex strategies  Theres also a mechanic that lets you influence whos most likely to be targeted  which Im always grateful for in large parties  Theres a system where you can substitute one characters turn for anothers  extremely useful when there are so many enemies who can only be hit by one character  There is also a hard mode that makes the game actually hard  and forced me not only to use my items but to think about which ones to buy and craft  unlike in Paper Mario where I only really did the cooking minigame for completions sake   However  I find the balance choices absolutely baffling in many cases  Most notably  unlike in Paper Mario where your attack stat improves periodically over the course of the story  here your attack power improves… never  You can only boost it with specific pieces of equipment  which cost a ton of points  are exceedingly rare  and frequently come with downsides  For example  in Paper Mario  the badges that exchange your stats 1 Attack  1 Defense or vice versa cost 2 badge points  Here  they cost 5  only 1 less than the Paper Mario badges that increased your stats with no strings attached which dont exist at all here  There are badges that slightly improve one characters special attacks… but also increase their TP cost iin addition toi the badges themselves costing a whole level ups worth of badge points  which is just so incredibly not worth it   Unfortunately  for some reason the game seems to be balanced as if you were getting stronger over time  because enemies keep gaining more and more health while you plink away at them for the same two points of damage each attack  Battles quickly became tedious and frustrating by the mid game  where I effectively had to burn through my entire TP if I didnt want to wage a war of attrition  one I would inevitably lose  because HP growth is also exceedingly slow  made worse by the fact you dont get heart or TP drops after battle like in Paper Mario  It also made enemies with even 1 point of defense an absolute nightmare to deal with unlike in Paper Mario where your dedicated armor piercing character ignores defense completely  here he only ignores 1 point  and your other characters can do diddly squat if they dont want to burn TP on stronger moves  Paper Marios flipping mechanic let you nullify the defense of almost every armored enemy  but here its an afterthought only applied to a few enemies  Possibly one reason for this is because hard mode adds 1 defense to enemies that dont normally have it  so it wouldnt make sense to have them be flippable in normal mode… but  honestly  that just means it was a bad idea in general   Writing wise  the game attempts to correct the main problem of Paper Mario  Lack of character focus and development  Unfortunately  Bug Fables also has this flaw  just told over three times as many words   Unfortunately  the non silent protagonists are so annoying they make me miss the days of controlling a silent blob  Every conversation goes on just a little too long  often so that every character can chime in to either state the obvious or beat a joke into the ground  Goombario somehow manages to have more personality in his tattles than all three of these heroes put together while so many of his tattles featured worldbuilding or character details or genuinely funny jokes  Team Snakemouths tattles rarely tell me anything I dont already know when theyre not spoiling the solution to an already simple puzzle   The dialogue is also just… off in a way thats hard to describe  Its not  like  terrible But it just gives me the niggling sense of being… Terminally Online is maybe the most accurate description Everyone sounds like they have not had in person conversations for a year  Characters talk very stiltedly  like  theres a whole sequence where the characters act out a play  and the obviously parodic dialogue barely sounds any more stilted than how they usually talk  Kabbus entire schtick is having extremely bad and corny dialogue followed by the other characters winking at the camera and saying “See  we know its corny” as if that makes up for having to read it in the first place  Characters also seem to have no sense of boundaries  tact  or emotional self control Kabbu and Leif constantly complain about how childish Vi is  but theyre hardly any better themselves with how often they go off on histrionic mood swings  Leif  in particular  is the extremely awkward “author mistakes verbal abuse for funny snark” archetype   I wonder if part of the problem is that the story speeds through the groups introductions to one another  and after that theres just nowhere for the group dynamic to go  Once youve declared theyre Bestest Friends Forever after knowing each other for five minutes  no more tension or character development is possible  Even the characters legitimate flaws that logically ishouldi create conflict are passed off with little more than an “Oh  you” from the others  Like  youd think maybe Kabbu the knight in shining armor might have some long lasting friction with Vi the selfish greedy mercenary  especially after she  oh  bleaves him to die in the very first dungeonb  but no  he immediately declares all is forgiven  Youd think that maybe Vis selfishness and only helping others for the promise of a reward is a character flaw shes supposed to grow out of  but no  its just a hilarious thing for her to say every single quest followed by Kabbu chastising her and getting rudely blown off every single time   The whole story just seems allergic to the idea of intra group strife  and it kneecaps basically every attempt it makes at doing anything halfway interesting with the characters  Vis subplot gets close  but the others fall over themselves to forgive and help her way too quickly  Im particularly irked by Leif having a Big Awful Secret constantly dangled in front of us the whole game with the subtlety of a sledgehammer  only for the reveal to be… completely meaningless to everyone involved  Kabbu iliterallyi says  “This doesnt change anything”  Even the parts of the plot that arent character related are extremely cliche and regressive  The villain is a street urchin who usurped the rightful monarch  because its important we remember poor people are the real evil  Immortality is bad because the fact a few people might abuse it means everyone else deserves to wither and die  I found myself really missing how Paper Mario was just a silly adventure romp instead of trying to say anything profound   So  overall  I was left very disappointed  It made a very earnest effort to carry Paper Marios torch  but it just didnt have the strength to bear the weight  I can only hope it inspires more developers with fresh ideas to try their hand at the concept   “Abombination” was a genuinely good pun  though ",2022-08-04,2022-08-04,False,4,0,0.491741925477981567,0,True,False,False

deep get in the way of any sort of emotion the game tries to muster up  A lot of the plot feels like its been cheaply designed in order to wring tears out of everybody   and as a result  the game NEVER turly earns its tears  only being able to cheaply grab them through false emotions and false characters    And what false charactes they are  For example  there is a character that is defined almost exclusively by her mental affliction  I am trying to avoid spoilers here for the people who havent played the game yet  but I will have a section on spoilers at the very bottom of this review for people who have beaten it already  Anyway  there is pretty much nothing to that character   her personality and actions merely come off as side effects of her affliction  Wheres her feelings Wheres her personality Theyre not there    And on top of that we have the grossly manipulative plot   look  heres a song you can cry to that has  two notes Arent you so endeared because its two notes And  Hey  we have this actress character who wont stop being pretentious and preachy about what she has to say Isnt she DEEP And hey  heres this character with a sad fate that we bring up with no foreshadowing whatsoever AT THE VERY END OF THE GAME Doesnt that make you SAD Point is  the game is trying so hard to show itself off as having a DEEP STORY that it  ironically  reveals its own shallowness and the flaws of its own plot   All the annoying rage aside  the shame of To the Moon is that it could very well have been a good game  The setup itself is very well done  and could have very well been a breeding ground for all sorts of truly emotional stories  There are a couple of admittedly charming moments a talk on Doctor Who  in particular  actually did make me smile inside  And the game has very well done 16 bit esque graphics  However  all of these little good things about the game do barely anything to get away with the bad taste of the story and the game as a whole   Some people might complain that the gameplay  which pretty much consists of collecting hidden objects to get to the next memory and then solve an fairly easy tile puzzle  is barely even there  and that is also true  I am not opposed to a near complete lack of gameplay if the games story is well done         but  as I have of course mentioned before  the story feels manipulative and its emotions feel unearned    In the end  I would say that if you really want to play To the Moon   go right ahead and see for yourself what you think of it  To the Moon is  at the very least  a mildly intriguing experiement on how to tell a story within a game  and it must be experienced for oneself before one can really  truly judge it  And who knows what youll think You might even outright love the game  But   try to consider  if you can or if you want to  how desperately the game tries to wring tears out of the player  and dont be entirely shocked if you have a disappointed reaction like I did   4

spoiler especially when she did nothing but preach and preach about spoilerautismspoiler in general   On top of that  some of the games philosophies on spoilerautismspoiler felt like a huge slap in

sort is affected by it in different ways spoiler but I have a very hard time believing that any of them would be spoileras detached as River is in the gamespoiler without some sort of extreme personal tragedy   I do realize that in the main review  I do kind of come off as a bit of a heartless a hole  But this comes from anger at how   theres no other word for it   unrealistic the games spoilerportrayal of autismspoiler is  I do appreciate that spoilersome of the money that the game has received is going toward charities for autismspoiler   but the fact is  this game is the same type

gameplay  poor graphics  and nonexistent settings  Also note that I have played several games similar to To the Moon which I will shout out in my review  If youre looking for a good adventure game  just going off of stuff Ive both played and are available on Steam  check out the Ace Attorney Trilogy  Zero Escape  The Nonary Games 999 specifically  as that game is fantastic  killer7  or VA 11 Hall a  and there are loads of other games I havent played that seem better than this Telltales The Walking Dead  Danganronpa  Firewatch  428  all of the LucasArts games  etc   Hell  if youre looking for an Adventure game built in RPG Maker  Id highly recommend OFF over To the Moon  and that game is ifreei I have also heard good things about Yume Nikki and Ib  but again  havent played them  So lets address the obvious problems everyone already mentions  This game was built in an old version of RPG maker  which means a few things  First off  there are no settings to speak of  so I hope you like playing the game fullscreen with a low resolution  and I also hope you like clunky controls with inconsistent movement speeds  The graphics are also super generic  This isnt even a limitation with RPG Maker  OFF was made in this engine and that game has actual character design and an aesthetic protrayed in its worldbuilding  This is probably controversial  but I dont like the OST  theres a ton of piano songs and while they do provide a moody atmosphere  they largely blend together  As someone who loves video game music and will gladly seek out the music of games Ive played  I really have no desire to do so with To the Moon  This is especially hilarious considering one of these piano pieces is a major story element  Once again  OFF had an atmospheric OST  but it was farrrr more unique and thus compelling to listen to on its own on an aside  I adore its usage of spoilerSomewhere Over the Rainbowspoiler  The gameplay basically boils down to running around a clunky RPG overworld to find certain interactables and solving some extremely basic tile puzzles…hell you dont even play tile puzzles by the end of the game    So were left with one thing  The narrative  The story itself is mostly compelling and has a cool setup  Look through a terminally ill patients memories and change them so that they remember themselves being an astronaut and going to the moon before they die  It has a very moody atmosphere and the story at least gives good payoff to the things it sets up  However  the overall tone is suuuuuper melodramatic  like its actively trying its best to make you sad or emotional because of the music and the events we see the characters go through  But   I honestly dont care about any of that  because the characters and writing are quite poor  The characters are bland as hell and lack much in terms of personality or anything interesting I cant recall the names of most of the cast  and I have very little to say about the ones I do remember  While I can tell you about Johnnys life and what he goes through  I cant say anything compelling about him as a person  He uh   likes olives He wants to go to the moon His relations to other characters dont matter when theyre ridiculously uninteresting  River and Johnnys mothers characters have some good idea but ultimately they arent enough  The two leads have personality  but they also totally break the games serious tone with some really cringe y writing that sometimes devolves to just referencing things  and it often becomes obvious that this was an indie game made in 2011 Doctor Who references Really  I know it makes sense narratively since this is just another day of work for them  but it doesnt make for an entertaining experience  And again  they really dont do much beyond that  they dont have any character relations outside of themselves not even with Johnny tbh  so I dont really feel anything for either of the two leads  Compare them to some of my favorite characters  Phoenix Wright from Ace Attorney and Gillian from Va 11 Hall a  They are very silly and entertaining characters  yes  but they also have a number of fun and interesting relationships with other  similarly deep members of the cast Maya  Mia  Edgeworth  and Larry Jill  Dana  and many customers and randoms  on top of their own depth like Nicks backstory and his motivations to be an attorney  and Gills connections with Va 11 Hall as themes of coming to terms with your past and focusing on the present  To the Moons characters just dont have any of that     At least the story  in terms of the events taking place  is good for much of the game…at least until the climax and ending which are bawfulb  Its both nonsensical and RIDICULOUSLY emotional manipulative  I imagine the devs want you to cry during this sequence  but I was absolutely livid  To get into spoilers  spoilerhow the HELL is River the one preventing Johnny from going to the Moon  the loss of his brother and subsequent loss of his memory is the real thing keeping from doing so  There is absolutely no reason for her to have been moved to a later part of Johnnys life  and the fact that your partner REFUSES to explain anything while doing this is  also  nonsensical and only serves to add tension through that chase sequence  And then  they segue into this emotionally manipulative disappearance sequence with a disgustingly sappy song   ONLY THEN does the game back pedal on Rivers disappearance because of course it does  it obviously wasnt going to commit to rubbing out River  the game just wanted you to cry for a bit  Sigh   Im not against emotional story moments  but please dont force it and let it make sense i e  999s Sf Ending  Not like it wouldve mattered much in this case since  again  I dont feel much of a connection with these characters to begin with  Also  while Im on story spoilers  the twist that Johnny has a twin brother is pretty dumbspoiler  When I took all of this into account  I realized something…To the Moon has inothingi going for it  The graphics are mid  the gameplay is mid  the soundtrack is mid  and they even managed to botch the story  While it wasnt a straight up pain to play throughout  I cant say I came out of this game with a positive outlook   If you legitimately cried at this game  Im glad you were able to find an emotional connection that I couldnt  But also  Im sure there are plenty of other games that will make you cry harder ",2017-08-12,2021-02-25,False,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Even as a means of storytelling it falls flat in almost every way  Gameplay wise it is not fun in any way  with poor controls on the mouse and the keyboard side the game just feels bad to play  I ran into 2 gamebreaking bugs along the way that prevented me from continuing  being fixed by a restart which lost some progress  The game also trys to pad itself to make it seem longer than a short 3act  3 hour story   h1Arth1 The game has very sub indie pixel art  And a handful of digitially painted seens which looked rushed and pulled me out of the game world when they did appear  It seems that pixel artists just added a noise filter to everthing they could  It almost hurts to look at some objects  There are also several charecters in the game where they seemed to have applied a noise filter and not toned down the saturation of the noise  resulting in a few charecters being covered in rainbow speckles   The one redeeming aspect of the games art is the soundtrack which was one of the only things keeping me playing  It is the only thing that pulled emotion out of the dialog  which is very bad as well  But this was ruined several times by having a very hard transition to a different track often for the sake of comedic releif   h1Gameplayh1 It is a game so how does it play Very poorly  For an rpgmaker game the keyboard controls feel slugish and the mouse controls are infuriating  For the amount of needless walking around the game makes you do the mouse controls feel like they are working against you  You left click to walk  very simple how could it be bad  When walking long distanced you need to click on an icon that takes you to a different scene  The problem lies with the screen always moving the camera is locked to the grid that the charecters walk making the camera jerk as the charecters change direction  There is no smoothness to it making it difficult to click on things while moving  This tied with the charecters slow walking speed and long padded distances makes it feel like you are just waiting and waiting to just get on with the task at hand  The keyboard controls for walking dont feel as bad but the distanced are so long and the speed so slow it is just easier to wait on the mouse   The puzzles which are placed through the entirety of the first Act are the only type of gameplay this game has  You walk around placing the mouse on random objects that act as puzzle pieces  after you collect the necessary amounts you play a really easy puzzle which can be won by randomly clicking around ten times  You do this around twenty times  It is just a time killer a very boring one at that   Object placement in this game is horrid as well there was one instance where I though my game was soft locked  you normally click on charecters to talk to them or listen to them  This speech icon was just placed on the ground in the middle of to spaced out charecters  Several times throughout the game I had trouble finding the puzzle piece because they didnt even have an icon  The game also pads itself with really long camera pans and slow movement speed on long backtracking paths  With many reused areas that made me hate walking along them again and again    h1Story and Dialogh1 The game is well know for its sad story  I did not feel a strong enough connection to the charecters throughout the short 3 hours expierence  My connection to them was just barely strong enough for me to drudge through the awful two main charecters dialog to even finish the game  The reason I feel I had no connection the the charecters is due to half the game being a very bad puzzle game  I was hoping Acts 2 and 3 would payoff for waiting through Act 1 but it did not   Im going to talk about the dialog now and oh is it bad  Even the non cheesy comedic dialog feels like a middle schoolers essay for english class  It is ok but not amazing  But the dialog between the main playable charecters is awful  The game was made in 2009 and it dates itself hard  The writers seemed to have a hard on for name dropping things  They talk about Doctor Who  Animorphs  Google  and many many others  It is just awful and makes the game feel straight out of Tumblr  The game told me to just google something about the Animorphs books after I answered incorrectly  It is so hard to take the sad story seriously when they through garbage references at you   h1Summaryh1 The games cult like following does not hold up  even when overlooking the dated nature of the game  It is not fun and its story simply is not good enough to make up for how awful it is to play  Its so short and filled with padding with its story loosley tossed throughout at 2009 meme and joke ridden trainwreck  This game is not fun  and its story not very good  It wanted to be sad but the only things I was sad about was wasting a few dollars on this  If you do want to expierence its still after reading this whole review just watch a long play on youtube  it wasnt worth my time   h1Final

flat  and not just because theyre 2D  The puzzles started out interesting  but quickly got repetitive  By the third act  I was agonizing for the game to be over so I could make dinner    My best friend and younger sister recommended this game to me  They adore this game  How am I supposed to tell them I dont  I remember my sister mentioned that she thought Id appreciate the game because Im a writer    Well  its actually only made it easier to pick out the reasons I dont  After some deliberation  I think the reason I and many others werent able to connect to the characters can be confined to a list of pretty simple issues   bFirst b the controls are janky as hell  If you can get past the awful moving controls and figure out the weird rightleft clicking mechanics  then youre a champ  I immediately noticed  however  that this game had no options menu  There was no way to make the game windowed  no way to switch the arrow keys over to WASD  and no way to in game adjust volumes  It wasnt exactly a great first impression    Further  the actual game play if you can even call it that is somehow both threadbare and confusing  You get used to what youre supposed to do pretty quickly  which would be fine if it werent that what youre supposed to do gets pretty dull just as fast  Clicking on objects that slightly stand out and fixing puzzles in a few more clicks isnt exactly engaging game play  which only hurts a gamers immersion    And then there are times when you get stuck and just start clicking on ieverything   i   The game previews itself to the gamer as an interactive  story driven novel  But its not  Its a movie occasionally interrupted with bad movement controls and very strange scene set up that mark flowers as impassable terrain    This is all more or less easy to look over  However     bSecond b The doctors  Ive seen a few reviews saying their humor feels forced and distracts too much from the story  Myself  though  I actually enjoyed their commentary  They often voiced what I was thinking  and their dialogue was used at times to foreshadow large character beats in the story  However  by the third act when Eva went off the rails  I realized why I was having trouble connecting with them  they had no personal goals   The doctors immediately introduce themselves as the comedic levity in this heart warming tearjerker  That works well and good  but even Guy from iGalaxy Questi has a character arc and fulfills his own thematic heros journey  The doctors are completely without   Get the job done and over with  Grab a cup of coffee and move on to the next patient  They say this in so many words multiple times between the beginning of the game and the end    It leaves very little room for me to root for them or  by extension  for Johnnys dream  Theres no interconnection  nothing to tie these characters together  so the journey feels like just another job but with a few mildly interesting hiccups   This leads me to     bThird b The character resolutions are poor and hollow  and some are completely nonexistent    Eva is mentioned to have a moment to moment life motto to get her through her job  I was hoping that seed would be watered enough to grow into an arc  However  its never expounded  challenged  or resolved  Neil is mentioned to be cold and calloused toward his patients  Thats not explored  challenged  or resolved either though he came closer than Eva when he challenged her over the contract they had to fulfill however  she took control of the situation  stealing that character moment from Neil and replacing it with literal zombies    Honestly  their personalities are simply flat just as 2 dimensional as the stylized world  And no matter how cute or comedic a scene might be  I was unable to stand behind them and root for their stories because they didnt have one    Moving on  John and River    Rivers story had the most nuance though  thats not saying much  By the end of the game  I had an idea of what had happened to her  and I feel like I understand what Im supposed to understand about her  but its only superficially explored and certainly not resolved  In fact  the ending felt anti climatic to me  because John certainly never had the moment of realization concerning River that the game worked so hard for the gamer to achieve    And John  his story is complicatedly wonky  His dream of being an astronaut  as I mentioned  right from the start feels empty and silly  The characters even say as much  By the time we find out what it stems from  theres so much baggage unpacked that his dream of going to the moon feels like a red herring from the real resolution we could be searching for  Neil even has dialogue talking about this  so I know the writers behind the game were aware of the issues unpacking so many metaphorical bags posed  The end of the game had one bow  but hundreds of ribbons  One origami rabbit  and iboxesi of unfulfilled paper   I wont get into details for the sake of spoiling the story for others because the game is cute despite its flaws  and you could at least watch a Lets Play if you want to enjoy the positive aspects of the story and game overall  John and Rivers arc isnt finished by the end of the game  but glossed over and slapped with a big ol NASA sticker  Its unsatisfying   Lastly  The third act is just a movie  You cant pause  save  or escape  either  So have water and snacks close at hand  And when you see the third act text pop up  take a bathroom break  Its like half an hour    bThat being said b  The music is absolutely lovely  I might

and items you want to show up but must keep a certain minimum number for each  Theyll take a bit to unlock as you dont earn that many chicken nuggets the currency for unlocking stuff even on a completed run   The last big thing is that the levels feel somewhat alive as even when youre offscreen  people are wandering about doing whatever  If a cop sees someone commit a crime  theyll go attack that person  If the blue gang sees the red gang  theyll get in a street fight  etc  Youll occasionally hear stuff going on offscreen and occasionally stumble onto some dead bodies and items lying around  Sometimes people get killed by random level obstacles   The game has a lot of problem  Its split into 5 zones consisting of 3 levels each  the final level  The zones are different  but mostly in just annoying ways  The 2nd zone has hazards explosivepoison barrels  minecarts all over the levels that you have to watch out for  The 3rd zone has cannibals hiding in bushes that will pop out and attack you if you get too close  The 4th zone has gangsters roaming in packs of 3 who will randomly decide they want to take your money  Therere also sewer grates all over the place where thieves will randomly jump out of and rob you  The final zone has roving robots that will attack you if they spot you for long enough  Anytime a robot or cop is engaged with you  the level throws up huge barriers blocking you in with your enemies   Besides that  the game is incredibly repetitive  To finish a level  you need to complete 2 3 objectives  These objectives are all pretty much the same  Kill this guy  get this thing from this guy usually by killing  press these buttons  destroy this object  Even playing as different characters doesnt change much up  If youre the cop  youre gonna play mostly the same as every other character  just make sure to arrest some people each level  If youre the vampire  youre gonna play mostly the same as every other character  if you find a werewolf  kill them  If youre low on health  find someone alone and drink their blood  Playing as the zombie and want to make zombie hoards  Sure thats fine for the first 2 3 levels  but youre going to be doing this for another 12 levels and its time consuming  By 4 6 hours in  youve pretty much seen everything   Therere a lot of items but ultimately you wont ever use the vast majority of them  simply because you forgot that you have them or because theyre not really as useful as you would like them to be  Ive got this hacking device  surely Ill hack a computer in the future  Odds are you never will because theres rarely ever a need to  Ive got these window cutters  Ill sneak into some buildings  Odds are you never will unless its the only way in without causing some sort of mass riot  Your inventory will constantly be filled with stuff you think you might need in the future  but probably never will as its rarely necessary  Youre better off just selling most of it   The melee combat in this is terrible  To start  every time you or someone else get hit  they go flying 10 15 feet away  There will often be large scrums of 4 8 people  so good luck keeping track of where you and your enemies are when everyone is flying around the room  Because of this  melee combat often devolves down to you just spamming the attack button in their direction or a circle around you  Hitting enemies can cause them to go flying into walls  destroying them  This means everyone outside gets to see what youre doing and often causes policeanyone allied with them to come flying in and start shootingattacking you  Theres no reason for this to exist other than the fact that if you could fight people one on one constantly there wouldnt be much challenge  So breaking walls was added to randomly create chaos to fuck you over    You can gethire people to follow you around as a crew  By default  youre able to attack people in your group or allied with you  If you decide itll be fun to form a gang  odds are youll hit most of your crew in a fight against one person  In any sort of large scrum youll almost certainly accidentally murder your whole crew  Theres a trait you can level up and get that prevents you from hitting your teammates  but you have to be fortunate enough for it to randomly show up  Some classes like the zombie start with this  Even more fun than this though is that your crew will often incidentally hit someone not involved in a fight and now that person is hostile to you  This will often cause a 3 v 1 fight to turn into a 3 v 15 fight as half the level is now hostile at you  despite you not even doing anything  Youre better off not having any followers since odds are at some point  theyll do something to get you killed   Ive already mentioned some of it  but theres a ton of random nonsense that will annoyfrustrate you or simply get you killed  For instance  every 3rd level in a zone has a random mutator that causes some event  This can include things like a killer robot shooting rockets at you all level long  a gang war  police attacking anyone outside  or after a minute or two a sludge starts filling up the level and you lose 2 health each second you walk through it  One of the mutators causes random status effects every 15 seconds  One status effect is Dizzy which makes you lose complete control of your character as he wanders around in a small circle  Have fun if someone is hostile to you and you randomly get the dizzy status    cause youll be dead before you get control back  The third zone will sometimes have landmines randomly placed around so youll sometimes stop somewhere to do something and get blown up  Expect most of your deaths to be a result of some random nonsense   Then theres the annoyance of constantly having to be alert for any number of things  Oh  here comes a thief down the street  better change directions or he might randomly rob me  Oh  here comes a vampire down the street  better change directions or he might randomly bite me  Oh  therere some cannibals  better walk another way or theyll attack me  Oh  here comes a zombie  Oh  here comes a robot  gotta run away from him or wait for him to go somewhere else  oh look land mines  oh look explosive barrels  oh look poison barrels  oh look wall thompers  oh look a switch that activates pits  oh look grates that shoot out fire  etc   Only bug I can remember running into is that occasionally some person  in a building with no windows  would magically see me through a wall  turn hostile  and come running out of their building to attack me   Streets of Rogue is somewhere around an above average game that is fine for killing some time  but it quickly gets too repetitive  It seems like it wants to encourage you to try doing interesting stuff  but theres either no reason to most of the time  punishes you for doing so  or just frustrates you with the random annoying garbage that occurs

96729184,76561197991890672,0,56,388,0,388,2021-08-01,english,"Its kinda meh The premise of the game is a Groundhog Day scenario  and if youre familiar with Minit  Majoras Mask  Outer Wilds  etc you should know what that entails  The Forgotten City doesnt execute this setup very well  I dont recommend the game for 2 reasons  1 its buggy and poorly optimised  and 2 it doesnt do anything interesting with the time loop mechanic  Note this is a game about learning information kinda  so this review will have spoilers in it by the third paragraph or so   This game had persistent technical issues from me  for the entire duration of a playthrough  I had NPCs stuck in a busy state stopping me from interacting with them  NPCs stuck running into walls  constant frame rate issues  and I managed to clip through walls and get stuck in the void outside the map several times  The world doesnt have any loading screens  but the performance ground to a halt as it tried to load new areas around me  I even had a few deaths where I was under attack and the game couldnt load the map properly  so I was stuck frozen whilst it was loading   and unable to avoid attacks   For the second point  this is going to involve some spoilers  Ill avoid NPC names and wont talk much about the story  but theyll be plenty of mechanical spoilers  Unlike some other popular reviews  Ill try to not ruin the endings by saying how to unlock them     Theres a few mechanics in this game that ruined the experience for me  Notably  theres something in the game that literally whispers hints to the player  It does this for all puzzles   even if the player hasnt realised theres a puzzle to solve yet  This took away the opportunity for me to solve anything for myself   it even told me which dialogue options to not pick in important conversations  Narratively this mechanic worked  but mechanically it destroyed the game  This is a game where the player is rewarded for using past knowledge  and punished for trial and error  and the game regularly tells the player the solution before the puzzle is presented  Hated it    The Forgotten City unfortunately wears its old mod trappings too hard   it has mechanics because they were in Skyrim  even if they no longer seem to functionally serve a purpose  Im not sure why they even added money as a mechanic  for example   theres only 3 places to spend money  1 of which is useless gives pointless information  1 of which is a quest which is better to solve without money  and the last the game actively tells you to steal instead of buying  Yet money is everywhere  Theres some chests with over 2000 gold  1 place to get 5000 gold  and its easy to amass over 10k gold per loop  Theres dozens of places with 100 200 gold or so too  Whats the point Theres a few other carry over mechanics like this too  such as crouching  swimming with breath gauge  terrible combat 3 ranged weapons  ONE enemy copy pasted about 30 times  infinite ammo  character creation perks  etc  All of these could be cut from the game and the game would still probably be better for it    I also didnt like how the game handled time loops  The day ends and loops if anyone you or npc commits a sin  Your inventory persists through each loop  so theres no consequences for theft or being naughty   youre actually rewarded for sinning and rewinding peoples memory of it  Whilst the player is not the only actor aware of the time loop  the player is the only agent thats actually doing anything  There is a single scripted narrative event in the game the vote  which always ends in a sintime loop  but otherwise NPCs dont do anything  They walk around a bit  but they only react to things the player has done  Theres no secret conversations to catch  no missable timed events  no areas of the map that openclose  no quests that can change the world state  etc  Most NPCs have a single quest or interaction  and that quest requires the player to do one thing  Doing that one thing is the last time the player ever needs to interact with that NPC   theres literally an NPC at the start of each loop that will repeat your past quests for you  and speedrun them faster than the player ever can  I didnt need to work out routing or efficiency each loop  which is something games like Vision Soft Reset and Sexy Brutale do particularly well   Each loop continues until the player has made a bad decision  then it resets  then you try again and dont pick that bad decision again  There is a passage of time  but 100 of my loops ended prematurely  so Im not sure how long the player actually has  It feels like I had too long each loop though  I wouldve preferred a world like The Sexy Brutale where I had to be in the right place at the right time for key events    As for the plot  its alright  The writing at the start is terrible  and it gradually gets better  I was genuinely interested in the plot for the last 30 60 minutes of gameplay  but the NPCs are too shallow and one dimensional for the story to be memorable  Theres just not enough interaction with each NPC to give them time to shine or make me care  and some major plot critical NPCs notably in the palace  and in endings 2 4 dont have more than a few sentences of dialogue  Its also far too easy to talk everyone down  You can get people to renounce decades of faith and murderous rage by asking them can you not do that The ease that ending 4 can be talked through is particularly egregious   As a final point  this is a game about exploration and it uses invisible walls everywhere to stop you

outright stupid MOST of the time  The ending  however    wow man   I wont comment on the visuals theyre not particularly spectacular but the focus is moreso on the gameplay and story so I dont think ragging on it for its graphics is very productive    This game has a lot of deadweight and threads that fail to connect  I didnt know this was originally a mod until I had already completed the game itself 24 endings  not that any of them matter aside from the last one but knowing that it makes a lot more sense  Theres combat but it consists of using a bow to fight exactly one type of enemy and to activate certain things like platforms or vines to make them usable  Theres money in the game but it serves literally no purpose  there is nothing go buy other than information and it is useless every time  and even if its not doing the option where you dont pay is almost certainly better  Theres nothing else to buy   no weaponry  no ammunition not that getting it is an issue  no food or anything of the sort  All other items in the game are found through exploration   Supposedly  the writing is also superb  I dont think its necessarily bad  but theres really not much time to explore any of the characters nor to develop any significant attachment to them  There wasnt anyone by the end of the game that I really gave a damn about  although there were certainly characters I detested  The game also has choices that arent actually choices  Theres nothing wrong with having dead end options in dialogue  but theres only one way to go about things at the end of it all  You want vergil to do what you need  you HAVE to stop him from being harassed in the town  No ifs and or buts about it  Someone in another review said the game might as well have just been a visual novel  and in this regard I agree   One thing is that I find that the world is also not particularly convincing  Rather than feeling like a Roman world  it feels more like a modern city with a roman skin on it  The characters dont really convince me that theyre Romans  They make allusions to myth and roman history and things of the sort  but aside from their names  costumes  and jobs they dont really differentiate themselves from people I meet every day  The voice acting itself is fine  no complaints on that front    As for the story itself  I was initially intrigued  The worldspace and what was going on with the so called Golden Rule did make me want to solve the mystery behind it  All the reviews suggested that the game was really fantastic in this regard  and with the spoiler warning on the main menu I thought for sure I was in for a treat  But in reality  my worst fears were absolutely realized by the end of it all  Even as I stood  mouth agape at what was happening  I held out hope that something  anything was going to come and knock my socks off and really take advantage of the tropey mess of an ending that had been set up  Out of the respect I do have for the dev team I am putting cloaked spoilers below if you really want to know    spoiler The first twist you learn is that the roman city is in reality just a paved over greek city  which in turn was an egyptian city  and before that a sumerian one  I thought this was interesting  and the small worldspaces you get to explore relating to each culture is nice and detailed with separate costumes and decor for each  As it turns out  you were never in a city so to speak  instead you were in the underworld where you arrived after death  All the other cities you find that predate the Roman settlement served as that cultures underworld  each with its own specific underworld god and whatnot    Going into this  my greatest fears were thus  that the big reveal was going to be either that the entire game had been some kind of stupid fake computer simulation  or that all of this pagan god parallel crap was leading up to aliens  So when I finally found the four missing plaques from the grand temple at the top of the city  and accessed the final gate  I was nervous   Then I walked out onto a certified motherfucking space station  and knew it was exactly what Id feared  In short  there were never any gods  aliens from some place called elysium had discovered our fledgling earth and decided that they wanted to enlighten us   well  one of them did  one calling herself prosperpina  her ultimate goal was to ascend humans to elysium or something of that nature  but to do so she gave up her immortality and was frozen in time by pluto  the alien ruler of the underworld  You get to talk to the alien guy and ask what his deal is and find out what the motivation for creating the forgotten city was  among other things   Then you shoot prosperina in the face  steal her crown  and teleport back to plutos den of cringe after looping to show him what youve done  This is a part that I really dont understand  For some reason  Pluto is also affected by the time loop amnesia crap that everyone else is  and so he doesnt remember who you are    which seems really fucking stupid  frankly  and feels really plot convenient  Since you arent affected by it  why should he be  if hes such an epic alien mastermind But he is  and so you get to force him into a corner and make him disband the underworld or choose to let his beloved die  Im paraphrasing and leaving a lot of gaps but the point Im making is that a lot of things in the last bit of the game make no sense and feel very contrived or convenient  Aliens did it all  there were no gods  it was all because of some bet that jupiter made with pluto  spoiler  I wouldnt call this game terrible  really  Its clearly something people worked on and loved  Its not some junk sold to make a quick buck  But I really think the game is seriously overhyped  incredibly predictable  and cluttered with unnecessary mechanics  The mechanics that are necessary arent utilized well  No real player choice or multiple solutions to problems or even any npc activity means that the looping is only something you have to do in order to relieve fail states or to advance to the next section of the story  I dont think theres really a lot here thats especially unique or well done in the end  and the conclusion of it all left me baffled and not in a good way  I got 24 endings in 5 hours  and when I say that the canon ending is the only one that matters  I really  really mean it  And for 25 bucks  it just isnt worth the price     ",2021-09-04,2021-09-04,False,17,0,0.571461200714111328,0,True,False,False

perfect game to get  visiting a Roman city  political intrigue  a game that might really make your choices matter  highly praised story etc  It was on sale for the Lunar Sale so I grabbed it   At first it is fun  finding an ancient temple leading to a grand bath  seeing these strange statues watch you  having the city come back to life  meeting people from across the Empire who have their own lives and wander the city and getting a lot of Rome in a nice bite sized package    And then it ends there    After a few hours you see your choices dont matter  You must reach the ending the devs want you to reach  Granted they give you 4 to reach  But one ends the game in 10 minutes so I doubt the others that arent the canon ending are any better   As one small example say you want to play around with the election thats happening in the city  sorry no  the game ends if the right person isnt elected   Trying to get somebody to stop harassing one character leads nowhere for all the dialogue  Theres one character you can have a debate with  But if you dont reach the correct ideas you are forced to start over from the beginning because you cant advance now  Your starting choices dont matter either  I chose two of the 4 backgrounds and neither had any real effect on the game  For example if you pick to be a solider you get a Glock with 10 bullets  but you get a bow and can cheese for hundreds of arrows  so that background is moot   The other I tried was archaeologist and all I found that gave me was the ability to figure out random facts about two or three things in the world that didnt matter for the story  You get to know Anubis was the god of the Underworld by looking at a statue for example  as if you wouldnt know that already  and you get about one dialogue choice you can work around anyway  So another worthless choice  And then combat  Youre told you can skip combat and horror aspects in the game  But then to progress you have to    fight the scary monsters youre told you can skip in the palace  So something that should be the biggest choice    isnt a choice  And finally whatever you choose in dialogue doesnt matter  You have to say the right string of dialogue as chosen for you by the devs or the character refuses to listen to you  And you dont get to bribe  charm or whatever characters  Only one character can be bribed  and thats only for the election  Only one character can be charmed  and she refuses all your charm  You must say what the devs want you to say  and reach the correct conclusions or the gamequest stonewalls and you have to start over   Theres more but Ill move into what really breaks a game for most people  bugs  All kinds of goofy game breaking things  Like one character getting stuck on something and not moving until a script for him to go to the election unstuck him almost an hour later  Other characters will be busy for 20 minutes just waiting to talk to another character who never shows up for the soirée   In part of the map I was under the city and a character two layers of Earth above me started a conversation and I died because that conversation yanked me into space  Then of course the game autosaves at the instant the conversation started  thankfully this time I wasnt yeeted but I still was starting at goodness knows what  talking to somebody about a mile above ground  I saw some of the statues craning their neck in funny  inhumane angles to look at me  less of a bug and just more of lazy programming   Characters must stop their action  turn their body and angle their head to look you in the eyes for dialogue to begin  and Ive seen one get confused  not be able to look me in the eyes and then just give up  So after I waited for him to fail I ended up just talking to the back of his head  Theres more  but once again Ill move on   The story was written by a Reddit user  To sum it up quickly youre basically told all religion is the same and of course bad  that morality is subjective and up to whatever interpretation you decide to give it and although this is the only opinion the devs have they dont stick in your face  its safe to assume that interpretation must be the correct Tumblr approved one   Your character also has never heard of Christianity and when encountering an underground group of Christians just assumes theyre some strange cult  A few other things make it clear the devs want a world where nobody knows what the worlds largest faith is  And then of course 2 characters are gay males one of them OF COURSE being one of the Christians and one is a lesbian though you dont find out about her until the ending  I understand that Romans tended to be more liberal about that kind of stuff  but in a village of 23 people you really expect me to believe that 3 of them prefer the same sex as their lifestyle and not just as a favor of drunken parties to forget about in the morning  The deep story everyone raved about become pretty clear after 2 or 3 hours of running around and basically only has the one ending where you  the great atheist  conquers God whos an alien and saves everyone so they can be sent to the 21st century and be liberated by internet liberalism  Of course you dont get a choice  why would you think that Though of course  the magistrate of the town who was trying to save everyones life the best way he knew how  and arguably he had a point  he just went about it in a disagreeable manner  but it didnt warrant what happens  is punished and rightfully so according to you and the other characters by being forced to live the rest of time as a statue while the rest of you sleep with whatever partner you chose  put on yoga pants and look at memes  Im not kidding  the baker admits she loves yoga pants and memes in the canon ending   I could go on and on but you get the point  The game is beautiful  it has some interesting aspects that could work well in a better written game  And it is cool to walk a small Roman village  But that beauty will be marred by bugs  lacking points in lore like why are these statues still here The Romans believed in treating their dead right and deep dialogue that ends up not being as deep as you thought  This game of choice has one story to tell  and you best go along with it  For a game that wants to say sky man who tells you what to do bad  it sure like to force you to do what it wants or be punished ",2022-02-01,2022-02-01,False,8,2,0.496946483850479126,0,True,False,False

one ended up low on my list  Overall I would say it is worth considering if you are very desperate for another fix of this genre  or totally new to this genre  Also  yes  I finished the game in 26 hours without guide and with time to spare to run around grinding and solve easter eggs   PS  STOP UNSUMMONING MY PET   SPOILER WARNING BEYOND THIS POINT  Simple improvement suggestions    Show item flavor text in Tool Summary  Aged Lalaque Berrys flavor text is significant  please stop hiding them  I read everything the game show me and even the diary in shipwreck as well as eavesdropping people yet I have to rely on guide and hint from community to find this one AFTER my second playthrough  Slap that flavor text into players face every time they collect something new  use the same screen that you show newly captured pet   Cutscene tutorial skip option for replayability    Higher difficulties  crank that number or limit stat increase item usages    NG at least  post story content is welcomed let that ice spell tome be used    Weapon crafting not enhancing  crafting  create new ones for variety and testing    Adding stun resistance stack count visual for enemies in combat   Localization suggestions    In shipwreck diary  Jade mistakenly wrote about himself as herself context mistake I presume    In ending cutscene  simply have her say You pass  instead of You pass the test  would give better context   Some of the point that lead me to this conclusion    The game is too easy  you pretty much one shot everything from 30 40 of the game story onward I was playing on Normal  and there is no Hard mode  double checked after finish the game just to see if any higher difficulty would be unlocked  In second playthrough  with melee that have built in AOE every other strikes build I start one shotting even before reaching South Island less than 10 of the games story length  barely out of tutorials without using any stat increase consumable  first try the hermit crab    No post story content  no NG    No cutscenetutorial skipspeed up    Crafting options and crafting system is mediocre  both in quantity and implementation    Ice spell get introduced too late into the story  limiting its uses  the slow effect is cool but same as Daruks blessing  I only realistically use it once in the very last fight and thats it    You cant craft extra staff for mix and match for example using AOE spell staff during mob grind and healing staff for major fights    Some systems are hidden too well  I didnt know I can have more than one pet in battle before 70 of story is already finished  but again  they serve little purpose as I one shot everything anyway    Easter eggs also too well hidden  For example  I spent one whole hour running around the wrecked ship trying to find the key to the room in the lowest floor and still can not find it  I was trying to find it naturally without relying on guides  I never use guide on my first playthrough   Other personal opinions    Story feels rushed at the end  like they have to end it somehow so the conclusion is weird    Characters are sometimes very annoying due to cliche clinging    Too much sentimental talk during rush hour  Your comrades are fighting tooth and nail to give you a few minutes to finish the mission and you sitting over here watching a reunion scene  It is just personal opinion  but it does turn me away from enjoying the writing personally   Things I skipped because I cant guess how it works    The girl in Boar Plain with the snake like creature on her neck  I know she is there for a reason but every time I try to interact with her she just surprised that I am a witch  and thats it  The only thing I can think of is try to wear disguise but that is disabled in combat area    The bottom room in the ship wreck  Got the diary book  no clue to be found inside    The lightning dragon horn  I got the Ancient Lightning Dragon horn but I cant find a way to jump to where the Lightning Dragon stand from the hermit crab island    The puddings quest from Ralph    The turtle outside the house I spent an embarrassing amount of time experimenting with this try to wake him up    The egg from the chest behind the elite dragon in Dragon Valley    The lightning sword from Ancient Lightning Dragon I was thinking about using it in a rematch with the dragon but I didnt build melee so I skipped it    The 3 Elks at Lalaque Forest Northwest    Luna Mothers spring  And probably a lot more  This game have a lot of easter eggs made that way  show you the door and ask you to find the key

so far I reckon the game can survive a negative one  The game costs less than 10 quid  so buy it away if you know what you re getting  I played the Prologue first so I knew what I was getting but I got it anyway because its so cheap   The tldr of it is that I found the game more frustrating than entertaining  and while I keep coming back for the elegant simplicity of its design  the game punishes me with boredom instead of rewarding me with enjoyment   First  the game  You play as one of three characters  You start as The Wanderer  and there are two more characters that have to be unlocked  So far I have unlocked one other character  The Ronin  The two characters Ive seen have different starting tiles moves they can make and different specials  The Wanderer can move through enemies  while The Ronin can push enemies back   To unlock The Ronin and the other character you have to defeat a boss for each  Defeating The Twins unlocks The Ronin and to unlock the third character  whose name I dont know because I havent unlocked it  you have to defeat Nobunaga the Wicked  I am going to go out on a limb and say that Nobunaga the Wicked is the final boss  but Ive only reached to The Statue  one boss after The Twins  so I dont know  Maybe the final boss is Eren Yeager   The game loop is a turn based fight in essentially two dimensions  Each level consists of a few squares that can be occupied by one character or enemy at a time  Movements are to the right or left only  but some moves can effectively teleport a character through multiple others  sometimes striking them in the process  Besides moving you can fire off attacks and special moves by choosing a tile like a card  Tiles are placed on a Last In First Out stack and the stack resolves hint hint M tG hint with the press of a button  at which point all the tiles in it are executed without interruption   When you kill an enemy  they might drop some coins or potions  Potions give you temporary power ups or heal 3 HP you start with 10  The healing point is    edamame  Wha  After every fight you find a sort of idol where you can upgrade your current tiles  or two pedestals offering you one of two new tiles  You can spend coins to reroll the offerings of the idol or the pedestals  You can also spend coins in shops you find on your way through the overland map that takes you from fight to fight   When you die you lose all the coins  potions and tiles you had gained  Some fights are boss fights and defeating a boss gives you some number of skulls that you can spend to buy new tiles at the start screen  If you do  those tiles have a chance to appear on a pedestal in your next runs  You can also spend skulls to upgrade shops by adding more slots where items appear  If you die before defeating any bosses you get no skulls   The idea of a linear  turn based fight where you can only move and strike in one dimension is simple and elegant and is what keeps me coming back for more  but the rest of the game is a chore   One big problem is that fights are very inconsistent  I dont like to whine about the RNG but I will have three or four runs where I fail to make it past the first boss  Daisuke the Charger   Then Ill have one run where Ill make it three bosses later to The Statue   I dont know whats past The Statue OK  I suck  OK  Whats really frustrating with all that is that every time I lose  Im taken back to the beginning and I have to do all of the same things over  and Over and OVER again  Thats mind numbingly boring  like a game of snakes and ladders   I get it  the game is a roguelike  I play Nethack  right I die all the time in Nethack  But  in Nethack you have 13 classes as of version 367 and a garbanzillion of items  Every time I die in Nethack and start a new game  its a different game  Every time I die its in a different way  In Shogun Showdun hereafter  Sho Sho every time I die its in the same way bloody pikers  and every time I start a new game  its the same game  with the same character  with the same tiles  with the same special  on the same map  and facing the same enemies in the same way   Even the different tiles you can find do not add much variety after all because the majority are rather narrow in scope and I find myself selecting the same few ones all the time   Swirl  Arrow  Spear and maybe once in a while a dash or a curse  So theres no variety there either   Thats  b o r i n g   That boring is a direct consequence of the elegant simplicity of the game that I note above  so I dont know what can be done about it  and I apologise to the devs

so far I reckon the game can survive a negative one  The game costs less than 10 quid  so buy it away if you know what you re getting  I played the Prologue first so I knew what I was getting but I got it anyway because its so cheap   The tldr of it is that I found the game more frustrating than entertaining  and while I keep coming back for the elegant simplicity of its design  the game punishes me with boredom instead of rewarding me with enjoyment   First  the game  You play as one of three characters  You start as The Wanderer  and there are two more characters that have to be unlocked  So far I have unlocked one other character  The Ronin  The two characters Ive seen have different starting tiles moves they can make and different specials  The Wanderer can move through enemies  while The Ronin can push enemies back   To unlock The Ronin and the other character you have to defeat a boss for each  Defeating The Twins unlocks The Ronin and to unlock the third character  whose name I dont know because I havent unlocked it  you have to defeat Nobunaga the Wicked  I am going to go out on a limb and say that Nobunaga the Wicked is the final boss  but Ive only reached to The Statue  one boss after The Twins  so I dont know  Maybe the final boss is Eren Yeager   The game loop is a turn based fight in essentially two dimensions  Each level consists of a few squares that can be occupied by one character or enemy at a time  Movements are to the right or left only  but some moves can effectively teleport a character through multiple others  sometimes striking them in the process  Besides moving you can fire off attacks and special moves by choosing a tile like a card  Tiles are placed on a Last In First Out stack and the stack resolves hint hint M tG hint with the press of a button  at which point all the tiles in it are executed without interruption   When you kill an enemy  they might drop some coins or potions  Potions give you temporary power ups or heal 3 HP you start with 10  The healing point is    edamame  Wha  After every fight you find a sort of idol where you can upgrade your current tiles  or two pedestals offering you one of two new tiles  You can spend coins to reroll the offerings of the idol or the pedestals  You can also spend coins in shops you find on your way through the overland map that takes you from fight to fight   When you die you lose all the coins  potions and tiles you had gained  Some fights are boss fights and defeating a boss gives you some number of skulls that you can spend to buy new tiles at the start screen  If you do  those tiles have a chance to appear on a pedestal in your next runs  You can also spend skulls to upgrade shops by adding more slots where items appear  If you die before defeating any bosses you get no skulls   The idea of a linear  turn based fight where you can only move and strike in one dimension is simple and elegant and is what keeps me coming back for more  but the rest of the game is a chore   One big problem is that fights are very inconsistent  I dont like to whine about the RNG but I will have three or four runs where I fail to make it past the first boss  Daisuke the Charger   Then Ill have one run where Ill make it three bosses later to The Statue   I dont know whats past The Statue OK  I suck  OK  Whats really frustrating with all that is that every time I lose  Im taken back to the beginning and I have to do all of the same things over  and Over and OVER again  Thats mind numbingly boring  like a game of snakes and ladders   I get it  the game is a roguelike  I play Nethack  right I die all the time in Nethack  But  in Nethack you have 13 classes as of version 367 and a garbanzillion of items  Every time I die in Nethack and start a new game  its a different game  Every time I die its in a different way  In Shogun Showdun hereafter  Sho Sho every time I die its in the same way bloody pikers  and every time I start a new game  its the same game  with the same character  with the same tiles  with the same special  on the same map  and facing the same enemies in the same way   Even the different tiles you can find do not add much variety after all because the majority are rather narrow in scope and I find myself selecting the same few ones all the time   Swirl  Arrow  Spear and maybe once in a while a dash or a curse  So theres no variety there either   Thats  b o r i n g   That boring is a direct consequence of the elegant simplicity of the game that I note above  so I dont know what can be done about it  and I apologise to the devs that I cant offer any more constructive criticism  I really have no idea how this game could be made more interesting  Add more starting characters More varied tiles at the start More diverse enemies  I mean  if Ive played the game 50 times I think I have  in 4 4 hours of play shouldnt I get to see something changing every time I start it  Despite my negative review  the game is cheap and still in

like master tao  samurai and the iron guards just to get like max 20 lines of dialogue and die  bosses are great except the final boss but the overworld is lackluster  gameplay wise its amazing  if

real way to interact or do anything with them  their stories abruptly end as you come along to slaughter them  with no interesting character development or conclusion for their own stories and goals

tilts making you want to puke  you are sometimes not even able to see your character due to the feet that try to stomp you in the 3th 4th and 5th phases or the screen tilt in the 6th 7th 8th and 9th  and you can take damage off screen  there are weird unnecessary objects all over the arena like feet  hands  eyes  mouths  triangles  steam reviews and light grey text  making it hard to tell apart what is and isnt an attack in your peripheral vision  and cluttering up the screen in general  the most rng dependent attack and the attack that lies the most in your peripheral vision is the light red text swiping across the screen  which blends in with the light grey texts in the background and the hands sticking out from the edges of the screen  having to do this entire fight from the beginning once you die 4 times is frustrating  normally i didnt mind it in the other fights and i had to start over for all of them many times  but the 3th 4th and 5th phases in this fight are already quite hard to dodge in nightmare  in standard its brain numbingly easy and it feels like a waste of my time to do it for the 100th time just so i can attempt the last 3 phases and get screwed over by rngesus and screen tilts again  the 7th phase is the true rng abomination that gates off the rest of the fight because it puts 2 rng attacks on top of each other text and bullets  so many runs ended with me getting to phase 9 once  then dying to phase 7 3 times in a row and starting over  its unbelievable you fight a boss so bad after one of the best in the game  algor hime  i spent 5 hours of

confused as hell about my time  have played 70 hrs in 3 games  it at first registered only 3 and now claims Ive only played 32 minutes  PROBLEMS  The basic jobs assignment system is a mess  Managing more than 10 people or a base is an absolute micro hell because     Workers will randomly stop working but never tell you WHAT happened  why they stopped working  At best theyll spout MACHINE IS  FULL and stand there like an idiot indefinitely   The inventory system is awful  Characters wont use their backpack if you gave them one  always hauling items 1 by 1   The items hauling  storage system is horrible  The AI requires dedicated chests for each item that can only hold a pittance  meaning the chest is quickly filled and your automatic jobs routine stops   There is no quick way to manage inventories of groups  especially problematic when you go out scouting ruins you must micro everyone to pickup their gear then manually balance the load of items between your party so they arent over encumbered then when you return home you have to give each person 10 hauling jobs to make them store all the loot and theyll still have leftover parchment or old maps because there is no container or use for them  save selling  so why not have lootable cash  The economy of Kenshi is busted too  You can manufacture goods and make stores but nobody will every buy anything but food or medical  so if you made weapons or armors or electrical components to sell  you have to caravan to a town  see above inventory problems     Your engineers will overfill their inventories with random leftover crap and stop working eventually  You can enable DITCH RESOURCES option in the faction AI settings  But theyll start dropping their crap outside your base instead of returning it to the proper storages  but better yet why do 2 of them each grab 3 iron plates to finish a turbine needing only 1 more  Medics are too dumb to grab new kits from a stockpile  do not try to use a medical stockpile or the doctors go on strike and you die of a minor stomach wound that wasnt treated because the AI doesnt work   Dealing with dead bodies at your base cant be done automatically  While you can just burn them  they like to rob you of your food and other items too so you REALLY dont want to be torching your own stuff not to mention the lootable weapons  armors  until you just dont care anymore in the midgame because youre staying in a low level zone  but right back at the endgame they start stealing world unique ulta high grade weapons and armors off your own people   Base defenses dont work properly  enemies will glitch walk through your walls and like to grab any downed people through your gate  rip engineers   Gates have like 5 seconds worth of HP  doors less than 2 seconds  bandits can break them with bare fists  if they decide to attack your walls the regular solid stone wall has even less HP and falls like wet paper   Your turret gunners will starve to death before stopping to grab food  When you load up a save any wall mounted turret operator will 5050 glitch through your walls to the outside  Pathfinding is broke as hell  You must micro and watch people moving from AB even short distances your characters will get stuck on a tiny rock or try to walk vertically into a cliff and just stop  which usually leads to them getting attacked and killed   Squadsgroups DO NOT share pathfinding and WILL split up  Finish looting a ruin  give them an order to return home  some start running towards the road  some start running through the wilds     THE DIFFICULTY  Did I mention the difficulty  you exist so you will be beaten unconcious  robbed of everything  bleeding out  kidnapped by slavers who are then attacked by cannibals and you basically die in 5 different ways at the same time  Well deserved reputation as a masochist sadist slavery simulator  The only way to win in the world of Kenshi is not to play   It gets even worse when you start a base because base raids start happening on top of the random patrols  and bonus unannounced attacks start showing up  and the local faction starts stabbing you in the back because everyone in this game are slaving d1cks  This quite fortunately relies heavily on location  and after getting raided for probably the 200th time in the borderlands I started a new game and immediately moved to an island at the very edge of the playable worldspace in an invalid zone for a much improved experience   The proper way to play the game is cheese metastrats  like kidnaping people and beating the  out of them repeatedly to grind stats to have attack skills  or getting your limbs ripped off to train toughness  or fighting hordes of low level bandits for multiple IRL hours with the worst weapon possible with a backpack full or iron and dead body on your back for stats grind  or straight up getting people enslaved to train their laboring  lockpicking and athletics  If you didnt cheat or cheese the system  you just get eviscerated by enemies with higher stats than you   THE UPSIDES  VERY Freeform experience  Go anywhere  do anything  kill anyone and the world can react to it a little bit   Good lore  worldbuilding and asthetics   Decent selection of mods  Most of them work  I recommend prisoner recruitment and advanced training because youll need an army of doom slayers or plenty of acceptable

is  I like it despite what it is  And it is a mess   First of all  you absolutely should not buy this game if mods scare you off  Without the mods  vanilla Kenshi is lackluster  It promises you the world  it promises you the freedom to do anything  and delivers none of it  Here are just a few examples                Can you be a bad guy in Kenshi Yes  Kinda  You can take your sword and go ahead and kill everybody provided youre strong enough  But thats the extent of it  What do you do with this So  you killed a town of people  Can you take it for yourself No  Can you rase it so you can build your own in its place No  Can you take the survivors as your slaves No  Whats the point Can you be a trader in Kenshi Yes  Kinda  You can build a stall which is just a storage  you dont even need to assign a shopkeeper and people will come and buy    things  You may think   hell yeah  Ill become the best blacksmith in this town and    oh    wait    they dont buy armor and weapons  Only food  Not to mention that you cant even create the best weapons to begin with  The body part system is also wasted  since you cant even target specific body parts  or even the relative area you want to hit  Its pure random  Which honestly makes combat a dull dice roll  instead of intence strategy  Some of the older gamers here may remember one treasure called Evil Islands  It also had combat involving body parts  Except you could chose what to hit  And it was so much more fun  And by the way    killing enemies Yes  thats random too  They often lay on the ground either dying  unconcious or playing dead in their status  And what can you do Nothing  Literally  nothing  Just wait until they decide to get up  smack them again and hope that it was a killing blow or at least made them bleed  You cant kill them off   Granted  there are mods that allow you to craft better weapons  sell weapons  capture and recruit slaves  take your enemies hearts out to finish them etc   but praising Kenshi for this is like saying hey  Stardew Valley is the best battle royale game on the market just because theres a mod that adds that mode to the farming simulator  Or saying that Skyrim is the best erotic simulator because there are mods that allow you to have sex there  Its not the developers or the games achievement  Its the modders   Second reason not to buy Kenshi is of course if you are looking for a story  Theres none  Other than the one that you create yourself with your actions and your imagination  Now  personally  I dont have much of a problem with it  I even find it somewhat refreshing  However  its such a waste  The characters you add to your party have some generic dialogues when you run around together  Generic as in   it doesnt matter if the character is unique  theyll still say same stuff as some free mercenary you can recruit in any bar  But these dialogues are actually good  The writing  however little there is  is really good  Which is why not having more of it is a terrible waste   Now  as far as stability goes  Look  I understand that Kenshi is a one persons labor of love  And I probably shouldnt be as harsh on them as I would be on an AAA title with a huge budget  But on the other hand  its still a game  its being sold as a finished product  and as a consumer   its not my problem  how many people or in what conditions made the game  All that should matter to me is   is it good and does it work properly To put it bluntly  Kenshi is far from being the best looking game out there  Lets be honest  its quite ugly  But thats not an issue  at least not for me  This is something I can easily forgive  What I cant forgive though is that Kenshi is basically a loading simulator  You cant run for 5 minutes without it starting to load yet another zone  and another  and another  And thats after the fact that the initial loading takes a lot of time and I mean A LOT  And while sure  the world is quite large  its honestly very empty  A few squads of enemies  friends  animals etc  here and there  a dozen towns all over the map and    thats it  I hate saying it  once again comparing AAA project with an indie  but Skyrims loading times were way better while the game itself was much busier  Theres nothing there aside from poor optimisation   And then there are bugs  Characters moving through objects being the most prominent  And you know  when its just a character getting stuck knee deep in some rock   its fine  Whatever  No big deal  Just a visual inconvenience  I can even forgive when they suddenly decide to go under the ground when trying to open slave cages in a certain camp  Its a video game  Shit happens  Whatever  Its not gamebreaking  just annoying  But when you build your own settlement and then characters can actually move through half the walls youve built    then its a problem  And a huge one at that  Theres a command in game that allows you to try and rebuild in game meshes  but again  its forcing the user to fix what shouldve been fixed by the developer  Things like this should not happen   And dont even get me started on how atrocious pathfinding is  Have you ever tried to get your squad from  say  the center of the map to the Hidden Forest and back again Good    bloody    luck    Best case scenario   they will be stopping to fight every single thing they find on their way  despite you having the passive mode  that should prevent combat  on  and then just stop in the middle of nowhere because they have no idea what to do next  Worse case scenario   theyll split up  trying to figure out the paths sepparately  Or hell  even better  one person will start moving  while the rest of the squad will stay and do nothing  Or they just wont move  period  Until you manually take them out of the area they are in  That is if you even can  and the bridge meshes arent broken along the way     Kenshi is fun  Theres no arguing that  And it only becomes better with mods that add all the things that shouldve been in the game to begin with  But its also undeniably raw and unpolished  It will bring as much frustration as it brings fun  And while personally I may enjoy this game quite a bit the 80hrs since the early access wont let me lie  I also cant recommend it with clear conscience  If you think you can overlook everything Ive told you about and are willing to mod this game  go for it  you will not regret it  However  I know a lot of people who only consume vanilla games  they need to get the best experience out of the gate  and the very idea of modding  no matter how easy  makes them anxious  And to these people Ill say   dont even look at Kenshi  Absolutely not worth it ",2019-01-09,2019-02-06,False,474,29,0.716558098793029785,92,True,False,False

it was freedom to do a lot of new things  and it was awesome and thrilling and new   On the other hand  the dashboard had fallen off  exposing sharp screws and mounting brackets which would kill you in an accident  the passenger door handle didnt work so you had to crawl through the window  and for some reason  it vented a viscous oily vapor when you turned on the heater   The tires were bald so dont drive it in the winter  and it also got 5 miles to the gallon   But it was something I loved anyways   Thats Kenshi   This game is an absolute disaster of broken features  bugs  and UI  AI failures that are almost impossible to work around   Guys walk through solid walls   Thats okay  you have to know the hotkey combination to rebuild the local world navmesh  duh   Guys get stuck inside barrels and other solid terrain  Just pick them up with another pawn and set them back down somewhere else   Its a feature not a bug  The UI is god awful   Rearranging jobs is done in a tiny window  cannot be manipulated for more than one guy at a time  and changing jobs up and down the list is tedious and awful if the list is long   The armor system is apparently also broken  due to a bugged stat called cut resistance efficiency which converts a portion of incoming damage into blunt  which sometimes causes MORE damage if you have layered armor   So make sure you have downloaded the mod to fix the broken mechanic  okay  Guys will drop off all of their food  then refuse to eat it from the containers  animal backpacks   Raptors will tear down your gates and eat your crops  and your guys wont aggro on them to kill them   Lategame production buildings which produce automatically are terribly implemented  and you have to know an arcane trick to convince the AI to empty them when theyre full dont tell the pawn to operate the building  tell them to fill a nearby container   Walls build with large gaps beneath and between them  friendly NPCs will attack your gate if you build a wall near a road    Theres just no end to it   And yet Kenshi is still fun   Fun in the way your first new car is fun   Youll have good memories  even if it makes you want to stick your head in a woodchipper for ten thousand different reasons   Did I love my first car  Yes   Would I recommend buying a 1986 Crown Vic to someone  Not if I liked them    List of mostly personal complaints  but also a few bugs   Lets keep adding to this thread   Why not   Im the only one who will ever read this  lol    When building structures  guys will only pick up 1 2 materials at a time  regardless of how much they can carry  leading to dozens of wasted trips    When building structures  guys only add 1 2 materials at a time  regardless of how much they are holding  wasting tremendous amounts of time    When building structures  guys spread build time across structures evenly  rather than completing one at a time consecutively  dramatically slowing down the rate of becoming operational    There is no job queue clear button   So if you added 20 jobs  you get to click the tiny X button 20 times    The job queue has a scroll bar that ONLY shows up if you have 7 or more jobs   This scroll bar pushes the X button to delete the job over to the left   This means that as you delete jobs  one at a time  manually  your mouse cursor  which was correctly deleting jobs  is suddenly unaligned due to the scroll bar disappearing  and you have to manually re align it unless youre on the one exact pixel that lets you delete jobs regardless of the scroll bar being present    When building crop fields  the fields are not visually shown until crops begin to grow   This makes it virtually impossible to Shift Click those invisible fields to tell your guys to actually start watering them    When cutting crops  the crop field cannot hold more than a few cut crops at a time   This means that for each full clear of a field  your entire team of 4 farmers will stop 3 5 times and run the crops to the nearest storage can    When emptying crop fields automatically  farmers will not take the max amount of crops  leading to your entire 4 man farm crew stopping their job to empty 14 the amount of crops rather than the whole amount themselves    Mounted crossbowmen dont auto target threats  even if you have Shoot first  ask later enabled on the AI menu    The AI menu is essentially hidden inside of another series of menus  and youd never really know its there unless you read about it on Reddit or something    When animals are killed  they dont die unless you loot something off of them   Then as soon as you take one thing  theyre dead dead    Even when your blob of guys is tightly packed  the games pathfinding will split them into multiple smaller groups  and take different paths to the destination   This essentially doubles or triples your enemy aggro footprint needlessly and causes deaths and damage that shouldnt even be happening    If you assign 4 farmers to auto harvest 15 fields  then assign an important skill like Engineer afterwards  you have to manually drag engineer up to the top of each of their lists  which is frustrating beyond belief because of how small the jobs box is  and you have to keep scrolling up every time you elevate its priority by 5 levels    Base gates do not automatically open  close as your guys move through them    There is no hotkey to open  close a gate that you have manually selected   You have to manually click the gate to select it  then in the bottom left corner of the screen click open gate  then move through it  then click Close Gate  then move on   Absurd that there is no hotkey for this basic command    Item storage has an arrange button that only sorts by size  not item type   So instead of all similar items being grouped closely together  they get spread out among other items  leading to a chaotic mess of an inventory screen    Even the game music is broken   It rarely plays  regardless of whether you have the frequency slider set to 1 or 20 either extreme    You cant rename your animals  which makes it hard to know what animal is carrying what gear in its backpack without manually checking each individual one    When you buy a broken house in a city  and you have the Engineer job assigned and active  your guys will steal building materials to repair it  meaning they get flagged for crimes and arrested   This happens even if they have access to legally obtained building materials   This is a wonderful example of the lazy programming at work in this game   Edit  Reworded to emphasize complaints and

entirely  and was totally dysfunctional   Ive recently reinstalled it after having played it in its betas on steam over the years and given it another 50 hours  and it has a new map  a new engine  and is still dysfunctional  but bare with me as I was in love with Kenshi at one point   To start with  Kenshi had an insanely long development cycle plagued with all kinds of bugs that stopped the game being playable  e g  bandits just teleported over your defensive walls  however even post launch  and with the devs saying theyre just moving on to Kenshi 2  the game still throws so much in your face to make it unplayable     Firstly is performance  Moving to a new engine did not seem to work any kind of serious wonders for Kenshi  Though even at 4K it cant max a GTX 1080 and i7 6700k  it spews forth unbelievable stutters and insane loading  However the game approaches asset management is absurd  with the game eating anything from 1 5GB to 13GB of RAM even without telling it it can keep extra areas in memory to reduce load times  At every step of the way  you find that a third of your time in Kenshi is spent waiting on loading  with an SSD making zero difference  You realize the game unloads assets that you see everywhere  like research benches or the same modular assets such as barrels and boxes that you will find no matter where you go  Switching characters is an understandable loading stutter as you change game regions entirely quite often  but there are times where you just move 30m and a new 15 30s loading stutter occurs  or where the game has just caused you to run 3FPS for a while doing background loading  and it was all for nothing because it stopped you to do another 15s loading chunk right after it anyway   The game itself seems demanding overall relative to its visual fidelity  The game looks like it should consume the horsepower needed to run the original Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic  with textures generally not being great looking but still being huge and a chore to load constantly  Much of this I think simply comes down to how much time passed from Kenshis start compared to launch  and how relatively little changed for the game in that time  If you turn on shadows  give it a draw distance that doesnt cull things right in front of your eyes  then you are going to start needing high end graphics cards and CPUs even for 1080p1440p play     Continuing with bugs  Kenshi likes to get selective with pathfinding if you move too fast or theres too much going on  the players pathfinding and ONLY the players will stop functioning  If you give new orders but the game has a lot going on even just a busy city without combat  you can wait 1 4 seconds for a response  Sometimes you will be fleeing from an enemy  and the game will just shut off your AI pathfinding and the enemy will catch up to you  The game does this so consistently that you frequently see it do this in paced stutters of 5 10 meters of movement    At this point Id like to clarify that I was in love with the idea of Kenshi when I got it  and even on top of all its bugs  I can see that sparkle of hope in its premise and what it pitches to you as the player  The problem is its complete lack of polish and general lack of optimization and balance     Now obviously Kenshi is meant to be a hard game  it likes to tell you how everyone is equal and youre no better  but in reality that is only somewhat true  The games idea of making it difficult is to simply have all NPCs in the world that you might fight be so unbelievably buffed in stats that lack of training and extra recruits simply guarantees your demise no matter what  The few enemies that might be relatively close to your difficulty early on are made to travel in groups of 10 20 so they can win just by taking all the combat turns   Ultimately the combat comes down to numbers  50 crappy fighters will still best 10 veterans as long as they get their chances to hit often enough  The game likes to take this to its extreme when it uses a system to send animals to come eat your crops  The animals arent hungry as most NPCs actually have hunger bars but autoregenerate it even without food  which just seems like wasted processing time  but they are just designed to home in on your crops to destroy them either way  If you fend them off but the crops still exist  every animal for a square km or more will come anyway  Ive had times where it literally sent over 100 swamp raptors to my settlement and Ive had 2 groups of mercenaries and an ally has sent reinforcements and they all get slaughtered due to it boiling down to a numbers game     Next is crashing  In the time it took me to write this  a thousand users have probably crashed  In the time it takes you to read this  a hundred more  Even without mods  Kenshi is a volatile program  Click a menu too fast crash  Build too many things in build mode without exiting it crash  Just played speed 3 because nothing is really happening for you to do at the moment crash  I think the game probably legitimately crashes every 30 45 minutes without fail  and since I started trying to use mods to alleviate many gameplay problems  it hasnt changed  Given the load times to boot up a savegame and load again  this ends up being very tedious very fast     Staying with savegames  they arent really saves  Theyre just regenerating the world with some data from what you did previously  You can load a savegame and NPCs will simply forget what they were doing and run away elsewhere  or people will forget the actions you told them to do  Often times you find that mercenaries die on their way to your base  or random attacks get critical NPCs like traders killed  and  you have to reimport your game  Reimporting literally just regenerates everything  and though its nice to have  the frequency of how often its needed speaks volumes of how bad Kenshi can be     Onto exploits  This games buggy state and general lack of polish leaves it open to all kinds of exploits  There are skills you can simply bypass by exploit grinding them within 90 seconds of starting the default wanderer start   You want to steal everything from everyone forever more Wait a minute for someone to get knocked down at the gates  and just put stuff in their inventory and pick it back up when they are playing dead due to their squad being wiped out  You get caught  it ups your thievery  but they wont get up   Want to steal from that safe that the shopkeeper never turns his back on because its a 247 store Just sneak in front of the shopkeepers storefront  he literally cant see you   Want swimming skill Just hold the move button instead of clicking once  and it goes up 4 times faster for no apparent reason   I could have written 2000 words dedicated to the exploits of this game honestly  but you get the idea    Kenshi is a great premise  A challenging world  you start from nothing  you recruit people  get skills  get money  start a settlement  rise above the challenges  But it underwhelms  There is a lack of sensible progression  early economy options are obsolete due to things like taxation  and exploits and bugs and performance issues are literally everywhere  on top of effectively lacking any serious end goals  end game   The devs already said theyre moving onto Kenshi 2 but keeping much of Kenshi 1  I fear Kenshi 2 is going to just be a charge to fix the game  This product was an early indie gem  but it is left in an atrocious state of wasted potential and general bug infested imbalance  I can see its charms  but every game ends with crashes galore  bugs en masse and issues mandating a restart not from the players fault    Without serious improvements  this is buggy trash  Maybe on an extreme sale its okay  but it runs like an Alpha of Skyrim and almost everything is dysfunctional ",2019-07-24,2020-04-24,False,530,54,0.714178025722503662,26,False,False,False

management  base building  interesting melee combat  exploration and many more  And it really has everything  Its just that everything is broken  I honestly cant name one thing in Kenshi that actually works  at least without spending hours and hours trying to find a way to make it work   Every time I start a new game  I make a simple plan that sounds fun to me  recruit some guys  establish a base somewhere safe  level your guys a bit  and go exploremake a new basedefend from epic raids  and raid enemies myself  Heres how it actually plays out   1 Recruiting   works at first  Recruiting itself is more or less bugfree  suprisingly  But  to actually recruit a squad  you need to visit several cities  And this is where you get absolutely destroyed by Kenshis pathfinding  the worst pathfinding that I have ever seen in any game  You characters will constantly move in circles  suddenly stop  and select the most idiotic path  expecially when they need to cross water  All this while getting killed by enemieshostile wildlife  Or they will simply refuse to move    2 Establishing a base  I would say that using Kenshis engine to implement a basebuilding is like trying to hammer a nail with a screwdriver  But its actually more like trying to walk your dog with a screwdriver  A perfect balance of laughing  cursing and wondering why exactly am I wasting my life on this broken mess Walls are uneven  building are uneven  you never know if pathfinding will actually allow you to use your walls and buildings  or if your guys will just get stuck and starve to death  Your turret may be able to shoot through 5 walls  or every arrow will stuck inside invisible barrier in the air  You just never know  You start with a plan  how you want your base to look like and function  This plan will never work  If youre lucky  you will be able to spend 10 20 frustrating hours building and rebuilding  until it becomes somewhat working  Not good  not how you imagined it  but somewhat working  without your guys running around in circles  getting stuck  starving themselves to death  or refusing to interact with food right in front of them  because there is a closed door on another side of your base    3 Now comes the fun part  fighting  leveling your guys up  defending your base  Right Nah  not really  Now you will see all the beaty of Kenshis AI  You put some guys on turrets  and some guys to guard your gates  Sounds good  right Here comes the enemy  some random single bandit  everyone else in his roaming squad got lost to pathfinding  And this little guy decided to start bashing on a giant gate  with 4 guys guarding it  and 4 more guys manning turrets above it  And then the miracle happens  All your guys just ignore him  No one knows why  So this guy breaks down your gate  And just walks away  No one knows why  Maybe he was a cat in his previous life  But wait  here comes a spider He should be hostile  right Well  yes  but he will also ignore your base  But guys manning your turrets will not ignore him They wont be able to actually shoot him  but they will definitely keep an eye on him  Because turret AI doesnt know of silly limitations like range or line of sight  And your guys get exp by just looking at enemies  while manning turrets  They can become literal gods of turret shooting without actually shooting a single time  Until another spider teleports through your walls and starts eating him   Okay  we kill teleporting enemies  open all doors and saveload 5 times  so our guys start functioning again  We get notification Raid moving to your base  Great  this is where the fun starts  at least this raid sounds scripted and it should work  right Nah  youre playing Kenshi  so half of the time raid will just get stuck thanks  pathfinding  But lets say they actually managed to get to you  And theres actually a lot of them  so you think Man  this seems dangerous  gonna be an epic fight  I might even lose here Nah  they will get defeated by their own AI    They always start with breaking down your gate  And it doesnt matter if all of your guys stand before the gate and ready to fight  It doesnt matter that they are getting killed  Break  The  Gate  Nothing else matters  because their whole AI is like 3 lines of code  So they manage to break the damned gate  losing half of the soldiers  Now the actual fight will start  Nah  just kidding  were playing Kenshi  AI only knows one thing  they managed to break the gate  it means they won  Now its time to loot So they go for your food  Not for chest with expensive booksAI coresweaponsarmor  Nah  too complicated  need to get those 5 sandwiches  So they will stand near that barrel with sandwiches  until you kill them all  The end    And this is just one example of gameplay loop in Kenshi  You have to spend hours and hours fighting bugspathfindingbuildingAI to get a smallest bit of fun  If youre lucky  Its great that some people find it worth it  But I dont  and I definitely cant recomend

development process   This was a game that has been being developed I think for 5 6 7 years at least now  At one time it was a niche game with pretty bad graphics but a unique idea and an ambitious feature plan  But now it has been taken over by a hardcore crowd as I dont think a lot of people play this anymore  though there was never a huge following   To keep it short Ill add the most egregious faultsissues   1 Amateur forum moderators are actively ghostingdeleting non complimentary posts   One of the biggest red flags for me is when posts that criticize or bring issues to the forefront are deleted or ghosted  The forum mods are nothing more than players who participate in discussions and have their own opinions and are not afraid to voice it  The difference being they have mod authorities meaning they are gatingcensoring posts that they simply dont agree with  Its not professional and means that when you visit the forums you are seeing an artificial picture  Its also dishonest and disrespectful    2 Game has turned into a hardcore bore fest  This game when it started had options to make the game more or less hardcore but even then it was a casual fun game with a wonky theme and quirks that let you forgive the awful bugs and so forth  But now NPCs are un killable and steal your stuff  NPCs with stats that are just bizzarre  animals who eat your characters and kill them  over saturation of hostile NPCs and a literal plague of new animal mobs  All of it now makes the game infuriating at times as you can lose a lot of progress quite easily   In light of the moderator problems and hardcore issues  its only fair to outline the continuing issues that this game has had since its inception   1 awful scripting  NPCs do not que properly  container break  they cant operate or manipulate things  Its been this way since the very beginning and has not been getting any better  I dont think they know how to script properly  It was forgivable before but by now its getting silly  I dont think this game will ever work properly     2 Path finding is plain awful  AI cannot navigate roads or move to and fro very well at all  This is another thing that has never improved  And probably never will   3 Graphics are pretty bad  The art style is kinda homebrew and the graphics are pretty krap overall  Its based off the OGRE game engine as far as I remember which was dated when the developer decided to work with it and by now its abysmally underpowered  4 Performance sucks  Youd think in 5 7 years or so that the game with its dated engine and lackluster graphics would grow into the supercomputers of the future  And nope  performance sucks to this date  With slowdowns routinely occurring and complete bog downs happening whenever new map content is loaded    5 Crashes  its BETA    its   ALPHA   its a crash mess  It has always crashed a lot  I am skeptical it wont do the same at 1 0  Playing this game means you accept its gonna crash    and its gonan do it often   6 No way to exit to the main menu from within the game  This might sound like a minor thing but rebooting this game and  waiting for a save game to load or to import to fix a bad save can take ages  Even on y fancy solid state hard drive  In all this time it has not crossed the minds of the devs to allow us to exit to main menu rather than the desktop    7 Hostiletoxic community  It has a small one now  but they have become even more extremist in a lot of ways  Like I said hardcore and you can count the forum mods among them as far as I can tell  I was here since before this game had sound implemented  bought it on DESURA before I got it on STEAM  So I got to watch the community turn into this over time    In closing  this game had a lot of potential at one time  But its plagued by a close minded developer team  hardcore community  and forum moderators who are not neutral and act as gatekeepers for what opinions get voiced on the forums  I personally run as far away from any game where the moderators are hindering discussion  especially when its to protect the game from criticism or to further their own interests                                          This game is out of Early Access and still suffers from almost all of the same problems  Only the performance has improved   Imagine playing for ten hours assembling a team of mercenaries and picking out there gear and rare weapons  Then imagine having raiders come in and steal all your gear  You can fight them off but if any of your characters go unconscious the AI simpyl steals weapons

many great ideas that got lost in an implementation that has severe issues of scope  Im sure by the time you read this Ill have invested more hours in it  simply because I desperately want to find that game  Although if I could refund it at this point  I would   NPCs are very flat  They all deliver the same kind of one liners with no real depth and they are easily forgettable since there is no story whatsoever  They just either sit around doing nothing  or run around aimlessly attacking each other  Combat animations are nice  but besides that  theres not much to their visual aspect either  Because of this  the world feels dead despite all the supposed simulation that it has going on behind the scenes  There is a lot of wasted effort in this regard because as the player you rarely get the impression that there is much going on at all   The world is huge and very empty  Combined with the fact that travelling you are bound to come across numerous packs of NPCs that will mercilessly attack and kill you  this will require you to play with a zoomed out view  distancing you even more from your characters and showing you a view of the game that highlights its age  Since the game world is so sparse  you will tend to accelerate time often  further increasing the sense that it lacks personality   Kenshi suffers a kind of dissonance in that its set up in a way that should allow you enormous freedom  but if you deviate from the standard become a warlord squad centered gameplay  it all falls apart fairly quickly   Trading is very shallow and unbalanced  Not much else can be said about it   Role playing is entirely on you  since the NPCs have no personality or depth of social interaction or no interaction at all  really  besides being able to exchange a couple of lines with you   Combat is very nice  but the only way to survive it is to rely heavily on cheese and grinding  or to build a strong squad   NPCs can slave you  but you cant own slaves the same way slaves for you are simply hostile NPCs that try to run away  The only way for you to grow your squad is to hire people   You can hire mercenaries for a fee  These are strong  temporary NPCs  But you cant be hired as a mercenary  You can only take bounty hunting jobs  You cant take any other type of quest because there are no quests  For a game that boasts how the player is not special  there are a lot of asymmetries that make the player a special case NPCs dont need to eat  for instance  and they can have higher stats than your characters can reach due to being capped   The mechanics at your disposal for filling your pockets suffer similarly to combat  There is no organic way to grow  other to find a way to cheese a system that is initially strongly stacked against you in order to give you that sense of a rough world  However  once you cheese it hard enough  you realize its shallowness and the illusion fades away   Farming is rather pointless  since you can get food more efficiently by mining copper and buying food with it  This is a running issue with the whole game  Because it lacks any balance whatsoever in so many aspects  you need to limit yourself artificially in order to create fun progression dynamics  The game doesnt have them  A game needs to place limitations on its players in smart ways in order to entice fun  Unlimited freedom and difficulty are not excuses for lacking thought out game mechanics   Building mechanics feel like an afterthought and the UI is confusing and clunky  Base management mechanics such as defense and automatic orders feel lazy and unfinished  Despite Kenshi pushing you hard towards building a squad  managing it is a chore that becomes very cumbersome very quickly   Related to building  crafting is also a strange one  Kenshi boasts the fact that you are surviving in this world  Yet there is virtually no wilderness survival or crafting besides cooking dead meat in campfires  Again  the game pushes you towards building a squad  and setting up some kind of settlement where you can research technologies by buying books or blueprints from merchants that allow you to build stuff by buying building materials from merchants  There is no freedom at all in approaching survival  Until you have managed to create a self sustaining settlement  you must buy everything from merchants  Which means that the only way to acquire resources meaning  things you can sell to merchants for money is to get them from dead people or animals  which in turn forces you to either cheese them into fighting each other  or to get to a point where you are able to kill them yourself   There are sneaking and stealing mechanics  but they cant be realistically used for anything until you have cheesed or ground your way to better stats  By the time youve done it  you have no use for this mechanic anyway  Because of its mindless design  the game funnels you into a very narrow set of possibilities   All in all  this game is too ambitious  Its commendable for any developer to have stuck with it for 15 years and to have gotten to this point  But theres a reason any other wouldve abandoned it or scoped it down along the way   Even though its 2000s graphics and Ogre engine definitely show their age  it has great ambience and a kind of retro  clunky charm to it ",2023-04-20,2023-04-20,False,57,3,0.672700345516204834,0,True,False,False

and mined   On day 30 decided to at least see what the next town was like   So all three of us decided to go for a run just to check it out   We didnt make it   One died on the way  so I ran the other two to the town for safety and was going to go back and try to heal the third one up   Got the two into town and focussed the camera on the dying camera for a second   Wait   my other two are now showing in jail  What happened  No idea since the camera was not on them   All I had them do was run in the front gates     Started a new playthrough   This one was at Drifters Last   No mining nearby   You can only run back and forth to train athletics and swimming for so long   Not much money to be made just looting the starving bandits that the guards kill   I wandered around a bit  yay  Found a mine though it was pretty far out   Wait   what  A group of guys just swarmed me and I am now a slave   Checked my faction with them    they arent hostile to me  guess they are just opportunistic     Started another playthrough   This one was in the Great Desert   Ok   mining nearby   I stayed mining and researching for about 40 days   Bought a house in town  recruited a 5 guys since that is all that was there  got my researching up to everything on the tech 4 table I could do   Saved up almost 150K  found a Garru   Loaded up with supplies  it is time to set out  Left the hive guys there since for no reason people that you have ok faction with will come and beat the snot out of you because you are with them   Left them training and researching   Set out to find a base   Wandered around for quite a while  couldnt find a spot that had resources nearby that also had fertility   Multiple loads later I had finally learned to save quite frequently I finally settled on a spot  just because I wanted to start my base   Ok    oh  I am already out of mats   Nothing has been completed other than a house with beds because I need them for the frequent beatdowns I get so they can take turns recovering   Need to run to the closest town to get more   Ok take the Garru and a couple guys   I am so beat up by the time I get to town  have to rest up at the bar to recover   Oh wait   someone raided my base   Everyone I left there has been abducted by Canibals   Need to load again   Take the entire crew to the town  not leaving them behind to get abducted this time   Oh the closest village doesnt have the supplies I need   Ok  off to Worlds end  the closest big town   Multiple loads later because I keep getting swarmed by cannibals and hungry bandits  I get there  load up again on some mats and start back down to my base   Multiple loads later  I get back   Run out of mats again  and now I am also out of money   Still have very little built other than some mines and the house   One civilized group of hungry bandits actually decided to talk to me instead of just laying the beat down and asked for money instead of violence  I can respond to that  so gave them some money  Loved that option  wish more of them did that  all the others just attack  Went back to my group safe at town  sent them out to mine some more to get the cash flowing again   They are in a safe spot  set them up for that and went back to my base folk   Oh they have been beaten down again and are all in bed recovering   Wait   flashing city folk team   They had someone beat the crap out of them and one guy has been taken as a slave   Got the other two to safety  the slave guy is still in town   After multiple loads and attempts  I break him out of the cell and take him back to the house under cover of darkness and put him to bed safely at my house   Back to the base folks   They are all beaten up again   Ok  pick them all up and put them in beds to recover   Still nothing running at my base other than a stone mine  copper mine and iron mine  but dont have enough mats to make the processors for them to make my own mats   Need to run to town again for more   Wait   my guy safely at town is in jail again   Rescue him again  make sure he is not an obedient slave  pack him off to my house to recover   Back to the base   Swarmed by cannibals again  while I was running to town for more mats   They carried off one person   Not even going to try to rescue her   Sorry Molly   I have about 18 people  still cannot fight off one raid or attack  not sure if it is the AI with terrible fighting skills or the fact there is always so many people that come in the raids   Oh wait  the slave guy in town for some reason has run outside again and is enslaved again   WHY  no reason for him to keep running outside  house is private so no one can go in and find him  but decided to just abandon him to his fate  third time unlucky for him  Got so frustrated with not being able to accomplish anything at the base  I decided to start again   Another playthrough   Started off at Drifters Last again   Really wish you could choose where you can start  Looted enough to get a little bit of money  trained up athletics so I can run fast and decided to try at least to run to the next town to see if it has mining or something   Ran through different regions  was good because nothing could catch me athletics was about 40 by that point and wait    my character just said UGH and     died   No idea what even killed her  no mobs about   No one to heal her   Started another playthrough   Started off in the same spot   Safely ran to the hub   Recruited another guy  found a mine and started to mine for some money   Mine not progressing  what is up  Oh  one of my miners is being eaten alive by a spider that I couldnt see because of the camera angles behind the mine   I am crippled and he is dying   Loaded again   Finally got frustrated enough that not sure another playthrough is the answer     The camera angles are so bad and not intuitive   The ability to change to First Person view would be invaluable   The ability the turn off raids while building your base or at least not have them be swarmed every few minutes would be great  The bad guys always travel in packs  At least let us get something built without reloading 20 times   I get a lot of people love the challenge of the game  but there are some that like some challenge but would love to build and establish themselves too   It would be great if there was the peaceful option that you could turn off and on like in the Forest   Also  if your faction is ok with someone  they shouldnt attack you but they do anyway   The Slavers  even if they have no issue with you will see you sometimes and enslave you anyway   The Hero bosses will attack and kill you if you have bug men with you  even though they were sitting in town in the bar waiting to be recruited with no problems     TLDR   I wanted to love this game so much  but the frustration has finally won   It is unrelentingly difficult with no ability to make it less so I did put all the sliders on the easiest settings the camera angles are really difficult to get used to  with your view of your party blocked by the landscape   Building settings were difficult to place items in housing without having them in the middle of things  limiting where you can place them and how much in a house  and blocking other things ",2018-11-13,2018-11-24,False,176,60,0.653788506984710693,30,True,False,True

praise and saying its THE GAME  A game where you arent special  youre just a regular person in a post apocalyptic world trying to survive  It was like weeb fallout 1 with lots more party members  and youre loving every second of it  So you download the game and you load it up after it finishes downloading  you cant wait to get into the world   So you load up the game and go through the possible starting scenarios  You chose Wanderer since its the way the game was meant to be played and start your new experience  The character customization is okay  the faces are really ugly and you cant change them  but you dont mind  You just click randomize all and play with whatever you get   Instantly youre filled with a sense of aimlessness  What do I do Theres no goal  no reason to play the game  Well  you reason  I knew that before I came in  why not explore what the world has to offer So you explore for a bit and encounter some dust bandits  You try to sneak past but its in the middle of the day so you get found out and your character gets loop K Od until hes in critical condition  marked with the dying status  and dies   Well  you reason  Im not special after all  so I might need some more party members like the NPCs have  So you restart  find out that you can collect Hobbs for free  get the bar thugs killed by the guards and collect their armor  find a copper resource that you can sell to a nearby shop right out of the hub  and start selling copper  After about 30 minutes you have enough to buy the other 2 recruitables in the hub so you start exploring  Everything is going great  You eventually get a party of 13 members  and figure its time to explore  You do a bit of exploring  only to find yourself running into dust bandits again  Well  you reason  Im decently armored and I have a party of 13 members  I should be fine  So the bandits attack you and your entire party is either unconscious or dying  You try to sneak away but its the middle of the day youre discovered  and eventually everyone dies   Ok  you reason  maybe Im starting off wrong  I heard that the slavery start was OP since I can level my sneak and lockpicking very early on  Ill try that  So you do  and eventually break both of your characters out of slavery  You go to the nearest city  bad teeth  to test out your sneak skill  only to find it empty  Maybe it was a Slave start exclusive thing So you loot the villiage  try and recall where The Hub was  and run toward there  You arrive and find that city empty too  So you loot it  So is the shop nearby  You loot it  You go to the next town you know of to the south  and it too is empty  Is anything populated You run into dust bandits  but since your sneak skill is so high  you sneak right past them Except you didnt  because a stray dog discovers you and blows your cover  You die by dust bandits with a dog eating your mangled corpse    At this point youre just trying to convince yourself that youre having fun because you spent 30 bucks on this game  so you decide to play the game like a sandbox base management sort of thing  since thats what was advertised  Choose Wanderer  start up your base around the copper resource it was nearby the shop  find that building materials  food  and books which you HAVE to buy early on are too expensive to create a fast profit on copper alone  so you aim to get more members  You head to Squim  only to find it empty  Great  You loot the things you can the bags and maps are likely hidden in the chest with the best lock  the lock that you cant pick because theres no way to increase your lockpick skill other than to build a lockpick training course or actually pick locks and head back to base  Only to find that starving bandits are stuck in a loop in your base because pathfinding is so bad  So you get loop K Od by starving bandits  Ok  you reason  well at least my stats are increasing  They eventually die  and after a while of the copper trade  you find your base invaded by  you guessed it  dust bandits  The walls arent fully built yet because you cant afford them between trying to mine copper  iron for plates  researching for beds why can I create an iron press before a bed and training items  collecting materials for said bed and training items  buying books  and buying food  With only 4 people  So at this point  since your sneak skill is 1 and you have chainmail on  you already know whats about to happen   And now were here  If you sat through all that  you have a good idea of what the games flaws are  But to summarize    Youre not like everyone else  Youre actually weaker  Youre weaker than a singular starving bandit  which makes no sense    Theres no way to increase stats without either putting in lots of time into base building or risking death  And if you risk death thats one less person to help work on your base    Base building is so important that its borderline mandatory  I want to explore the world and see what it has to offer  but I cant without risking death because I dont have good stats or money to hire mercs  But if I do hire mercs my stats dont increase  meaning I have to rely on mercs to do anything    Most Companions start off weaker than starving bandits  Meaning that until you outnumber them  you will lose to them  This makes no sense     Pathfinding is so abysmally bad that enemies can literally softlock you  It happened in my experience above with starving bandits as well as with a group of ninjas in another run     Characters are really ugly  I randomized throughout all my playthroughs  but the one time I did try to customize I found no age slider or way to edit the areas around the eye  The idle stances are also really awkward     Some controls are quesitonable  Holding right click to select and pressing right click to move Moving when I wanted to check the inventory of something or preform first aid got annoying really fast    Lack of dialogue with npcs  You can really only talk to the faction bosses and shopkeepers  That makes the world feel really dead  The little side conversations npcs have in your party while changing areas are cool though     Lack of things to explore in the world  The world feels like an empty void  And the things that are there and I can actually explore are limited  because Im weaker than a singular starving bandit    You cant get any materials in the wilds other than ores  you have to buy the rest  So thats even less of a reason to explore and just start basebuilding    Dust Bandits   I really  really wish I didnt buy this  If any of this sounds like a red flag to you  you probably shouldnt buy it  Just figured I should give my two cents since everyone seems to be recommending and not sharing their struggles or frustrations

I was sort of OK with because the devs promised they were working on fixing it  This is no longer the case  The devs were originally going to backport all the work they made on Kenshi 2 in order to fix the issues with Kenshi 1  recently they decided to switch engines to unreal and made an internet poll asking random people if they should just focus on Kenshi 2 or if they should honor their promise to fix Kenshi 1 and work on porting that to unreal as well  80 of people who voted on this poll decided the devs should just focus on Kenshi 2  so this game has been abandoned  The base building aspect of Kenshi 1 is essentially unplayable  and the rest of the game is riddled with annoying bugs mostly related to flaws in the engine that the devs have said they cant fix without an engine rework  which will no longer happen  At this point I see no reason to buy Kenshi 1  if youve waited this long  just keep waiting  maybe Kenshi 2 will get it right  The concepts of the game are solid  amazing even  but the devs have simply failed to realize their game with this attempt  it just sadly doesnt work   Ill leave my original review below                  This is a bit rough and hard to get into  The idea and what a lot of other people parrot  is that your character isnt special  so you have to work for things  but this is a lie  Your character is very special  they basically start out with the abilities of a handicapped grandma incapable of fighting their way out of a paper bag  There is nothing in the game world you can fight  at all  even 1 on 1  You walk up to something and whiff at it in slow motion and it instantly swats you to the ground in a single hit like you are some sort of over sized gnat  Your character is so bad they are very unque and very special in this world  and theres no way they realistically would have survived before you took control of them  Thats fine though  because you can train them and eventually become the super hero this game claims you arent  and single handedly take out an entire squad of enemy fighters without taking a scratch  So in essence this game is a grind  and this statement about you not being the chosen one is an excuse to start you below the bottom of the games scaling  increasing that grind significantly   The beginning of the game  as a comment I read somewhere put it  is a walking simulator  If you look at the top rated guides one of the fastest methods of getting into the meat of the game is to weigh your character down with heavy stuff and walk around in circles for many hours  That trains the running speed and strength stats  in addition to stealth if you toggle that at the same time  Once those stats are high enough you can then get into the action right No  Now you act like bait  you run around and find enemies  make them angry at you  then lead them to town guards who will kill them for you  and you then loot them and sell everything  This is why you need running speed and carry weight  you need to be able to outrun the enemies  and need the strength to quickly move their dropped items to a store to offload them  There is another option here  its basically AFK advancement  you build a copper storage in a house  tell a character to mine a copper node and then offload into that storage  then just wait as they do this automatically on a loop  You cant really go AFK at this point  they will probably die to wandering enemies if you arent paying some attention to them  but you can get a few characters working on this at the same time while you run around with another   Eventually you start getting into the real game  you can buy buildings  build stuff  get a base  start actually fighting  but its a long process with a lot of hurdles  and as far as I can tell that is the core of the game  the struggle and satisfaction of gradually achieving something  At about 5 hours into this I was about ready to give up and drop a thumbs down  but I pushed on for a couple more hours and started to see the light  There is a game here  you eventually get something thats sort of a hybrid of MountBlade mixed with RimWorld  with honestly a very Sims 3 style of world interaction and character control  but it starts you off in a very large and empty feeling world with very little you can actually do at first   This is a bit of an early opinion on the game  I might change it later  but I reached a point where I dont regret buying it  and was asked what I thought of the game  I dont love it yet  but if I can find the time to keep playing it and start getting into mods it might be something special         Edit  I put another 100 hours into the game  and my initial impressions havent really changed  The game is about the grind  but the grind is rather satisfying    I will say that having made it to late game a few times  the base building mechanics are rather rough and buggy  There are issues with pathfinding when dealing with large complex structures  for both your characters and enemies  and there are also issues related to the way the game unloads off screen assets that in many cases makes your outer walls useless as things just phase throughover them  Some of the mechanics are also easily cheesed  like simply walking away from your base during a raid and coming back after the enemy leaves  with nothing lost    If your main interest is the base building  I dont think this hits the mark  that part of the game is very deep into the experience  requiring dozens of hours of previous investment to reach  and it just doesnt really work well  It

having fun  but its addictive for the same reason plain gambling is addictive and not addictive because its fun  Its strengths are overshadowed by its weaknesses  and all of its weaknesses are some varying degree of frustrating or downright unfair mechanics  Here are some of the pros     Creative wand building   Great world and world gen   lots to explore and discover   Pixel by pixel simulation is an interesting and unique concept   Mods which can fix some of the most frustrating parts of the game  but a game really shouldnt have to rely on mods for that  And here are the cons     Wands can feel samey unless you happen to find the right spellspieces to make a unique wand  In a similar vein  making a strong enough wand to get by sometimes relies a bit too much on finding certain staple spells e g  chainsaw  black holeluminous drill  etc   It feels bad to be barely scraping by on a run  trying to find a missing piece that would elevate the run  but simply not finding it and dying as you struggle to put the pieces of a good run together in a crappy seed  Ive had runs where Im missing any sort of spell I can use for a good digging wand  and being able to dig is pretty important to this game if youre going for a long run  Digging wands are also just incredibly convenient and helpful    Exploration takes a long time  Its not a fast paced game  At the start of a run you have to be pretty careful  yet runs can end almost instantaneously and very anticlimactically at any time  This combined with no form of metaprogression beyond unlocking new spells can really suck    Pixel by pixel simulation is interesting until you realize how much jank comes with it  Game crashes  dying because you get stuck for a second on a single pixel you didnt see or get stuck in a wall  liquids like acid or lava splashing up unpredictably  touching a single pixel of fire and lighting on fire  the list goes on    Enemies are kinda weirdly balanced  One pet peeve is that many enemies will see you from much further away than you can see them love getting shot from off screen  On some runs youll run into a ghost carrying a wand from one of your previous runs  If its the beginning of your current run and that ghost is carrying a previous endgame wand  well  good luck with that  Overall  I always feel completely over or underpowered compared to the enemies  which doesnt make for exciting gameplay    There is not a lot of guidance in the game  Its simplest to use the wiki  Things like locations of interest or boss weaknessesresistances are purposefully cryptic  This issue kinda comes down to personal preference  but its my opinion that in a game where experimenting and exploring new things is important  you shouldnt be so severely punished for doing so punished as in going into a boss fight and dying in an hours long run because this boss is nearly impossible to fight with the current wand youre running  Also another hugely annoying feature is that you cannot modify wands outside of certain zones unless you have a particular perk that is nowhere near guaranteed to show up  Given that wand building is such a core mechanic and one of the most fun mechanics in the game  this needlessly strict limitation is just annoying  Sometimes it feels like vanilla Noita is a weird challenge mode of what could be a really awesome game because of limiting mechanics like this    The game is just all around unforgiving  For instance  there arent many ways to replenish health  which gets frustrating in a game where there are about a billion little and hard to avoid ways to lose health  Like the aforementioned getting caught on fire by a single pixel  Even if you put the fire out quickly  things like this slowly whittle your health away    Some perks you can get are downright bad for you  Im not sure why theyre even in the game unless youre doing some kind of meme or challenge run   Its truly a one of a kind game with a lot of potential  but its really not for everyone because of its flaws  Enjoyers of this game often point out that any run can be won or any death can be avoided if you have enough experience  knowledge  and skill   which yeah  thats how all games work  But you will bang your head against the wall dying in about a million bullshit ways before you get that experience  knowledge  and skill  and even then  the bullshit will sometimes be unavoidable  There are so many unwritten rules in this game to remember  and I personally just dont have the time it takes for all the trial and error to figure those out or find it fun to follow those rules  At the end of the day  you wouldnt really be wasting money buying this game and I cant say I regret getting it and the 150 hours I spent in it  but it feels weird recommending it because its one of those games youll probably have a toxic relationship with unless youre a particular kind of player ",2024-04-14,2024-04-22,False,18,2,0.604933977127075195,0,True,False,False

wondering too  This was one of the very few games I actually felt hyped about  and I bought it as soon as it was released  Ive had fun with it  and its a competently made game with a fun central gimmick  So what gives  At its core  its pretty simple  While Noita is fun  its also really miserly when it comes to doling out that fun  And thats something that just really rubs me the wrong way   h1Pay Your Taxesh1 One of the frustrating things Noita does is something more Rogue like games do  The games mechanics are conditional under a tax you have to pay  and that tax is you being forced not to use the mechanics  In Noita it comes in the form of a time tax and an inventory tax  See  when you start a new game  Noita isnt fun  Your starting items are garbage  so you have to find good items before you can start having fun  But the first level is purpose made to be absolute trash to navigate with a fresh character  and the items you can find there are often poor  There are other forms of time tax  such as the character being really slow  but most of it is that first level  The other tax is the inventory tax  See  the point of Noita is that you make your own magic wands from wands you find in the levels  These are random and often not very good  In standard play you can only edit items in the saferoom at the end of the level  which means you always have to sacrifice one of your four and slots to carry found wands to the end of the level   h1Pray to RNGesush1 Yes  yes  I know  complaining about RNG in a Roguelike  The problem is  a good run in this game depends on luck to an extreme degree  For instance  theres no real healing in Noita with a scant few exceptions  and you iwilli take damage  In fact  the reason you now start with a flask of water is because catching on fire before you could get one was a run ending first level problem  So your capacity to look for new stuff depends on your health  which you can increase with an item found in the levels  If you have bad luck and dont find many  thats most likely a junk run for you  Cant find good wands or spells in the levels or at the saferoom Junk run  Bad perk selection Junk run  Bad luck in one level makes you much more susceptible to bad luck in the following level  because it directly limits your capacity for exploration  And it doesnt end there  oh no  Theres a wizard enemy who can teleport your butt to random places on the map  Better hope its not too harsh  The worms that traverse the level can straight up destroy the saferoom  for which the game blames iyoui  spawning a strong enemy in every saferoom that you have to fight  Its even in the enemy placement  because damage comes easy in Noita  Clear an obstacle and see a lightning wizard Good luck with your new run  In the correct quantities these mechanics are all fine  The way Noita piles them up makes the game feel extremely arbitrary   h1Point and Shooth1 Noitas core mechanic is that it simulates every pixel  being probably the first real game to actually have a good reason to have pixel art  Its pretty cool  not gonna lie  The fact that you can empty a flask and dip it in liquid in the level to fill it up with is pretty unique  But it    doesnt really do a lot with this  Despite the environment being fully destructible youll only rarely use it to tackle problems  and then half the time only by accident  Theres very little interaction between the environment and the player aside from digging passages to get somewhere  When you get down to it Noita is basically just a sidescrolling shooter where you sort of get to decide what bullets you shoot  Even the kick your wizard can do to move loose objects is horrible  Theres a massive delay  its inaccurate  and sometimes barely moves an object  Oh  and enemies that are too close to an object when you kick it are likely to get no damage  This all comes back to the game just plain not wanting to give you the tools to have fun  The explosives in the levels are a good resource to blast passages if you have no digging tools  or just blow up enemies with  So why is my only way to move them around the worst kick in video game history iwhile Im a bloody wizardi  You still here OK  look  Noita isnt a bad game  Its more what youd call a diamond in the rough  But boy  its rough  Youre going to have fun with it  no doubt about it  but youre also going to get pants on head frustrated by it  Because its a fantastic idea marred by execution thats both really arbitrary and really afraid to give the player too many tools   Oh  and I almost forgot  One of the new features added is a perfect example of my complaints  Your wizard can drink liquid present on the map  If its a potion or similar  you gain its effects  If its inert  it simply disappears  Previously  you could keep doing it  and it was somewhat of a tool to lower the fluid level somewhere  The developers thought this was too powerful a tool  apparently  Your wizard now has a limited amount of stuff he can eatdrink  I wasnt aware of this thing breaking the game in any way  but OK  It doesnt end there  however  No no no  you ialsoi take damage if you overeatdrink iandi overeatingdrinking reduces your already slow movement speed  This isnt fun  This is a garbage mechanic with no purpose other than to limit the player  The only other game I know that has a similar mechanic is Kingdom Come  That is a game with an autistic dedication to realism  This is a game where you play a spellcasting wizard with a jetpack  If I want to chug a trench of whiskey because the game hasnt deigned to give me proper digging tools yet  can you just let me do it This feels too much like playing DD with a DM who feels threatened by your characters capabilities

decisions here at play which will make it or break it for you  Im not recommending the game because after 65 hours I havent managed to even reach the final boss  and trying to do so stopped being fun  And while the classic adage losing is fun very much applies in this game   I laughed many times after a particularly explosive death and even recorded gifs   after a while I felt nothing but frustration  since I just didnt feel like Im in control of my run    Now  Im perfectly happy to be told skill issue  git gut skrub   and Id agree  to an extent   but hey  I managed to get to the last area  which only 12 of players have the achievement for doing  so I think that perhaps this is not just a me problem  Anyway  I have three main complaints about the game   I believe all of them to be conscious design decisions  which some people might like  some people might not    h1Read the Wikih1 Do you like games chock full of secrets that you have almost no chance of figuring out on your own  and enjoy the community aspect of solving mysteries  aka hanging out on forumsDiscord servers and reading wikis This is such a game    Here are some vague  spoiler free examples of what I mean  Many things require some specific  obscure and very difficult feats to unlock  There are many mechanics in the game that are only vaguely hinted at  in stuff that normally would already be considered secretive  And some mechanics arent mentioned at all   the only way to find out about them is either by accident or by reading about them    And then  theres the worst thing  the sheer iscopei of Noita is something that youll probably never find out about by just playing the game normally  in an intuitive way  Thats what makes me believe that Noita is explicitly designed to be this way its no coincidence   In case this isnt clear  I really dont like such design  To me  getting info from the wiki is like reading the detailed plot summary of the movie before watching it  Gaming is and always will be a solitary  personal experience for me unless playing coop or something  I know many disagree  so just thought Id mention this here   h1Life is Short  Game is Longh1 The second problem is somewhat visible in the trailer  Its astonishingly easy to die  and not necessarily due to the enemies although that too   absolutely  You can misuse a spell  get caught up in an explosion  fall into a lethal liquid such as lava    point is  youre rather squishy  and while there is a way to increase your HP  its tedious and somewhat random   For the most part  its possible to avoid this issue with being very careful  How careful Well  almost every step into the unknown has to be done slowly and methodically  and groups of enemies are best avoided altogether unless you have some kind of big bada boom spell for that occasion fight them onetwo at a time  from familiar ground  Hey  no big deal that sounds just like Dark Souls  and that was fun Right  Heres the thing  the game world is ihugei  If you intend to explore in order to get better wands and health pickups  as well as farm some gold to get better spells   all of which you should   completing even a single area can be quite tedious  all because of how easy it is to die  You have to be careful  but theres so much ground to cover And thats only talking about playing the game normally  mind     h1Over And Over Againh1 And now for the final issue  I mentioned that the game has crazy amount of depth and variety early on  And yet  in spite of this  almost every run feels very samey  There is a lot of cool enemies  different spells that combine in crazy ways  and so much more    and yet  because of how difficult the game is and how easy it is to die early on  chances are youll never see any of those things   90 of my runs ended before things got interesting  And after a while you look in the mirror and ask yourself  Am I willing to start another run  considering how big of a chance there is Ill die before things get good  And you answer yes  you promise yourself youll be extra careful this time  you take things even slower than before    and you get a little further  Maybe  Or maybe it doesnt matter  because you simply cant find a good wand  or proper perk combination  etc etc  So you still die  same as before   Even though individual areas are procedurally generated  theyre still made of recognisable pieces   and after a while youll almost be able to predict the layout  Okay  not quite  but so many setpieces repeat  and considering how demanding this game is when it comes to repetition  youll end up running into the same stuff over  and over     h1Conclusionh1 Wait  thats all you have to say You did nothing but complain Im sure youre thinking  And you know  yes  I did  Because in the end all the goodwill I had for Noita   goodwill that my first few hours generated   melted away by those three fun killing issues   Do you like reading the wiki Do you like classic roguelikes where successful runs can be many hours long Are you fine with repetition Then Noita has a lot to offer you  Me    well  I think I made my opinion known   urlhttps store steampowered comcurator42922988Curator

stinginess with resources   Noita was recommended to me because I enjoy Roguelikes immensely  Ive played and beaten a myriad of them  and never even came close to completing others such as ADoM but still enjoy the run  In a good roguelike  from beginning to end  you always have a chance  The RNG giveth  the RNG taketh away  but there is often a consistency to your resources   Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is fair with giving you a variety of loot even though it is unforgiving with your fights  FTL is beatable with every starting ship due to a fair run of shops and gear  and the Binding of Isaac gives you at least two items a level  In any of these  even if the run ends badly  you never feel unfairly screwed by the RNG  as resources were available and usable  Making it to the final challenge  even if you fail the final challenge  usually makes me feel satisfied in a roguelike  In Noita  it just made me dread the next run   Noita  by contrast to those listed above  is much more inconsistent  The wand crafting system is astounding  understanding it lets you get further than ever   but the problem is  you need decent wands and some usable spells to get anywhere  This is where Noita falls flat on its face  First  you need to find wands   you can hold up to four at a time  You probably want a wand for killing things  a wand for digging  and a wand that carries some useful utility  So you have one remaining slot for testing new wands and taking along spells  assuming you find any   sometimes  after clearing the entire first level  I found a singular wand that could be reached with my starting bomb wand  Oh well   maybe well find one later Well  as you go down  many of the wands you find are strictly unusable   they either have a fairly good chance of killing you when cast or end up doing next to nothing because the spells are chained in a nonsensical manner  That is alright  you  a clever wand crafter  claims  I will simply fix the wand Well  about that     You can only edit wands in the Holy Mountain between levels barring a perk you can get  and therefore only remove spells from wands for later use in the Holy Mountain  The Holy Mountain offers a small selection of either wands or spells   but with the wide variety of spells  it is unlikely that any of them will be helpful for putting together a good wand for your continuing progression  But maybe youll find a spell that could make your damage wand a death machine  Do you have the money for it You see  gold disappears after a little while barring picking up a perk  The curve for buying items from level to level gets a little high  but enemy health increases multiplicatively  so beyond about the third area  if you cannot buy that nice Lightning Bolt you found  and you dont find any usable resources to avoid having to fight the enemies wands  or even potions  or perhaps the invisibility perk you wont be able to kill them in a reasonable timeframe and you will likely miss out on the gold drops  putting you further in the dark   not that half the crap in the Holy Mountains are good anyway   But more importantly  lets say you found two spells that would be useful when combined on two different wands outside the Mountain   as I mentioned above  you probably have one wand slot remaining for carrying and testing wands  So are you going to get rid of that utility wand or your digging wand Barring circumstances of good fortune  you might not be able to get it back   the Mountains are a one way trip without spells that can dig through the hard rock of the Mountain or side of the world  But if you have those  you probably are not lacking in resources anymore    The tedious early game is only punctuated by the lack of usable resources that most seeds have  The curve of enemy health gets absurd in the fourth area   if by the Holy Mountain of the third area you do not have a good wand or fortunate perks  you should simply give up  Your impoverished wizard should simply open the menu  and select New Game  But if you have resources  then the game and physics engine open up greatly and you can have great fun chasing secrets  exploring the levels  and playing around with the alchemy  The game is very enjoyable during those moments   and then  when you inevitably die  you have tedium rather than fun for the next hour or two    Some people advocate for using mods to fix these sorts of problems   several friends have said Yeah  beat the game for the achievements and then just mod it to fix it  Various highly subscribed mods offer the perks to edit the wands everywhere or to not have the gold disappear from the start or more ways to get your spells  and the sandbox is very interesting when you have the resources to play with it  However  I do not feel that excuses the inconsistency of the base game at all and the tedium that inconsistency brings  Many roguelikes respect my time and do good work to put tedium by the wayside by offering a variety of resources from early on   I would never mind having Yet Another Stupid Death if the game wasnt a miserly thing   As it is  I dont want to dissuade anyone from the absolute blast of a physics engine and the amazing wand crafting  Just be aware   Noita does not respect your time ",2021-01-05,2021-01-05,False,68,1,0.724124372005462646,0,True,False,False

of this game that I have obviously enjoyed  as Id hope to be the case for anybody that has spent a little over a whole week of their life playing  I dont want people to be necessarily discouraged from playing this game by my review  but I want people to know what exactly they are getting themselves into beforehand  The issues I have will be listed in three parts  in this order  The games difficulty  the time the game demands out of your life  and the obtuse secrets involved  But first  a short rundown of my experiences before hand   I had my first clear after getting about 70 hours of experience into the game  I think I cleared with 6 or 7 orbs  At the point of the map that Id explored And regrettably my rapid fire wand was also my drill wand  I had to reset the game several times due to performance issues  On later runs I learned that this could be offset by not making a luminous drill wand also shoot ranged bouncy projectiles  While playing  the game seems to encourage teleporting inout of holy mountains or drilling your way out of them so that you can come back later to edit your wands  This means a ton of backtracking  which I quickly got accustomed to  After my first clear I decided to install some mods that would save me time  such as more storage space for spells and items  as well as a free tinker with mods anywhere perk at the start of the run  I understand that this might seem like cheating to some players  and I admit that aspects of this can at times feel a bit scummy  but ultimately  this level of cheating matters little in this game  With how fragile the character is  it doesnt matter if youre carrying around 5 tablets and 13 potions  they aint gonna help ya  Tinkering with wands anywhere exists in the game  and generally feels like a better way to play  as you wouldnt need to spend as much time backtracking already explored areas  This perk helps speed things up  but if you cant find good wands or spells  it aint gonna help you either  Around 100 hours in  On a really successful and long run I picked up what I thought was going to be a spell and it was an elemental essence  This started exploding things around me  and I nearly died  I turned off the game and installed another mod that would allow me to remove perks  For a long while Id only used it the once  but never actually removed the mod  Later I realized that using this mod would allow the gambling perk to generate infinite perks  I did so once to see how op I could get  Didnt matter cause I got polymorphed and instantly died  To exemplify my point about cheating  while it doesnt FEEL good to do  the game doesnt care and will still destroy you  My max orb count is 21  and during that run I had started with every perk I could have wanted  Id built god wands and had climbed a secret area twice for some special wands  Spent 7 hours doing this  I just wanted to see what a max orb boss would have looked like to fight  to see if I could make a wand that could beat him without looking online  Didnt get the chance  Polymorph and cheating aside  lets talk about the main issues I have  starting with that difficulty  1  Difficulty  I think that this is self evident by the fact that the game has weeded out half of the players before they were even able to get to the third stage  Everything can and will kill you  You try to fire a wand you pick up  and the spells are in the wrong order or configuration  Youre dead  You step on the wrong pixel  youre on fire  Spell bounces and hits a crate of explosives Run over  Sometimes  While experience can solve these problems  sometimes things you cant explain or had no chance to deal with will end your run  Try to fire a wand that you know to be a safe wand At a distance  but there is a single pixel that you couldnt see against the dark background that your projectile hit and you explode on the spot  Getting hit by enemy projectiles that spawn off screen  Or when an enemy unit picks up a wand that has an earthquake or nuke spell in it and fires it once  These is nothing that can be done about some of these potentially game ending events  2  Time investment  This game doesnt care about your time  I understand that rogue like games have permadeath and are supposed to be difficult  But the sheer volume of content needed to actually complete the game takes so much time that youd have to be a monster to do it in one sitting  which from what I can tell  most rogue likes are made for  The fact that you can lose everything after playing one file for over 7 hours is one of the most punishing things you can experience from a video game  If you just want to get to the bottom and clear the boss  this aint a huge issue  but if you actually want to explore the bulk of the content this game offers  you need to be fully ready to spend nearly a whole 24 hour day of your life on a single run  Some streamers that I have watched have taken 18 hours and id argue that they are experts at this game to get the secret content behind this investment wall  3  Speaking of secrets  You wont complete any bonus content in this game without looking parts of it up  You may come across notes on the wall in an area of the game  and wonder about it  But youd be suicidal to actually willingly explore the area the key is in without a purpose to go there  I dont know if this was a glitch but when I finally obtained the musical notes  I went back to that wall and the notes were gone  I didnt think id have to write them down  Other secrets are just as obtuse  I dont want to spoil anything  just in case what Ive mentioned so far seems like a great CBT time  but there is a sequence of events involving statues that I thought were just decorations until I saw somebody kick one  While I respect difficulty in videogames  considering that Ive played vanilla and modded Minecraft on Hardcore several times in the past  these traits tied together like they are in this game leads to a feeling that is generally more punishing than rewarding  There are several things I think you must ask yourself before you ready yourself to sit down and play this game  Do I have a reaction time good enough to dodge projectiles fired from off screen  Am I smart enough or willing to learn the spell wrapping and speed augmenting wand building mechanics  Am I willing to let multiple hours of my life blink away instantly  Am I generally a lucky person If any of those are a no  you might not have a good time with this game  If you read my whole review  thank you  I dont mean to shit on this game  but I dont know if I have much will to keep at it at this point  I must commend the designers for making something that I got 200 hours of playtime out of  Was it enjoyment Some of it  Sure  Maybe most  But its bittersweet  UPDATE  I have put in an additional 400 hours of playtime  I have just now collected the final achievement  I stand fully by everything I previously wrote

85265945,76561198054444606,0,5,3976,0,1994,2021-02-02,english,"Noita is the best game I cannot in good faith recommend to you right now   Its an interesting and innovative take on the roguelike formula  and its myriad of good points can be found in other reviews  But in its current as of now 1 0 state  I have difficulty recommending it  The cause is a game design choice that  when it happens to you  is borderline unforgivable and usually instantly run ending  to the point of souring the rest of the experience   In Noita  between the main levels of the game there is a shoprest area a temple where you can buy spells and wands  and is the designated place where you are allowed to edit the spells in those wands the core of the games decision making  Youre encouraged to do this here  because there are training dummy statues that tell you the amount of damage your spells do  and anywhere outside of the temple you will be unable to re edit your wands if youve made a mistake unless you are lucky enough to find the relevant perk that allows to to do so   The problem comes in the fact that in Noita  almost everything is destructible if you try hard enough  The brickwork of the temple is remarkably resilient compared to the average material in the game  but with determined effort and ingenuity it can still be excavated by the player  Doing this is a huge cheese on the game  as it allows you to go back to previously visited areas  keep your wand editing powers  have a permanent safespot etc etc  So in order to counteract this  there is a system in place where if too much structural damage to the temple area occurs  you will have Angered the Gods  causing an extremely powerful and dangerous lich like enemy to spawn in the shop to destroy you in retribution  That means you CAN do it  but unless youre prepared for the potentially run ending consequences  youre discouraged from breaking the game too hard   All good so far   The problem comes in the form that certain enemies and environmental hazards can  and frequently do  cause damage to the Temple entirely without your interaction  There are giant worm enemies that can spawn at any time and burrow towards sources of food the player and through any material  including the temple  There are spider like enemies in the Jungle level that have the ability to burrow downwards to chase you  Acid burns through nearly any material  and a sub type of enemy that can appear as soon as level 1 BLEEDS acid when you shoot it  Any of the following reasons or more can damage the temple beyond the point the gods are willing to tolerate  often without your even having seen it Causing said enemy to appear  and more often than not  kill you before you have a chance to form a contingency plan  Fun not fun  The devs gave a token effort to remedy this problem in the form of crystal that repels digging worms in a small area around the shop  but it is woefully inadequate at its only designated function  Worms frequently dig through the rightmost area of the shop farthest from the crystal despite it  and the spider enemies and acid are entirely unaffected by it   The lead dev has expressed in interviews that he thinks this random interaction can be a source of fun for a run  and experienced players will hand wave this glaring issue with the game as acceptable because the strong enemy can technically be killed  and even cheesed if you are experienced but with the overall length of time it takes to get a run going compared to the relative frequency of these occurrences  I cant classify it as anything other than an egregious oversight in an otherwise refreshing and compelling roguelike   In my experience with the game so far  you will have a worm thoroughly ignore the anti worm crystal roughly 1 in 20 runs  And if you get a run deeper down into the game to the Jungle where the spiders hang out  they will ruin your day while tinkering with your wands roughly 1 in 5 runs  For a game where a good run can take 1 2 hours just to get started  this is a huge blow to enjoyability   EDIT FROM MORE PLAY EXPERIENCE  The other hidden danger is  literally hidden information  Most good roguelikes do a pretty good job making sure any mechanics are well explained  and information is not unduly hidden from you so that you feel like any deaths are strictly your fault and not the games  Noita does a reasonable job providing useful information about its spells and mechanics  but frequently hides critical hidden information from you about its spells and perks that can end up hobbling  or outright ending a run  This shouldnt be confused with me complaining about secrets which also frequently kill you  or the usual roguelike self inflicted YASD  or an unknown enemy one shotting you  thats normal roguelike behavior   For instance  there is a perk that tells you it reduces spell spread at the cost of increasing spell recoil  No problem there  However  if you pick it  you may suddenly notice that your spells also take longer to cast  a downside entirely unadvertised  In my case  it turned a tuned primary wand from my best combo weapon to non functioning  all because I picked up a perk with hidden drawbacks   Wands can have similar hidden passives based on what spells they have slotted  Electricity spell wands will instant kill you if you enter water for more than a few seconds  Fire spells can set you ablaze from the flaming tip of your wand  Noxious gas can come from wands with toxic spells equipped  None of these are advertised effects  You will eventually die to one of them you didnt know about before  or worse  forget about one youve already died to  and it wont be your fault  In addition  for wands that have an auto cast spell you cannot hover over the tooltip of the spell to find out what it is unlike a normal slotted spell  Dont know what spell that symbol is Too bad  Hopefully it doesnt get you instantly killed finding out   My recommendation is that if you commit to this game  you should break the unspoken rule of roguelikes and look up as much information about spells and wands as you can from outside of the game   The Spell Lab mod https steamcommunity comsharedfilesfiledetailsid2297568811 is particularly great at this as it has a challenge mode that explains hidden spell mechanic interactions that can help you get the most out of what does exist in the game ",2021-01-24,2021-02-01,False,38,0,0.687286078929901123,2,True,False,False

77761446,76561198053623119,141,6,779,0,779,2020-10-18,english,"Noita is the first game Ive played that was both extremely fun and extremely unsatisfying at the same time  You will definitely squeeze a lot of enjoyment out of this game  but beware that there is a possibility that you are going to hate it just like me  I hated this game  and I am finally glad that Ive finally finished it  In fact  Ive had to do it twice  but more on that later  You can read all the good things about this game in other reviews  like physics and incredibly flexible wand customization  chain explosions and large world with tons of secrets and quirks to explore  Ill try to elaborate on one crucial design decision  which completely kills it for me   This design decision is the always increasing difficulty curve  Why is this a flaw  you may ask The problem is  in all the other good roguelikes with permanent death and since Noita is marketed as a rogue lite  this comparison is inevitable  difficulty curve is either more or less flat  like in DRLJupiter Hell  or decreasing  like in ADoM or even NetHack save for That One Drawbridge  In ADoM  after you familiarized yourself with the game  you can still die in the early game even if you know what you are doing  especially if you decided to go for the riskier strat of Small Cave or even Bug Temple  but this choice is up to you  and you can always go for the way safer Infinite Dungeon first if you desire to  Once you are done with the ADoM early game  you are pretty much set for the entire run  For instance  there are altars in ADoM  and you can figure out to instakill monsters who step on said altar by sacficing them to your god  If you are really smart  you can figure out that intelligent monsters can do the same thing with you  so it can be a good idea to avoid stepping on altars if there are monsters nearby  So  you never step on altars unless you are 100 confident  thus fully avoiding the instant death trap  Situations like «I fell through the floor  landed on an altar and monster immediately sacrificed me» are so rare that Ive only read them on «Yet Another Stupid Death» topics in ADoM forums  but never encountered them myself in my 200 hours and multiple ascensions   But this is what happens in Noita on a regular basis  The world of Noita actively hates you  and the more powerful you get  the more chances for you to start over from square one  Just a couple of examples list  Holy Mountains are the only safe areas in the game other than the surface  and is the only area in the game which allows you to build your own wands  Got an explosion immunity perk Why not make a powerful explosive wand with a couple modifiers and test it right here  Boom  boom  you have angered the gods  a skeleton monster appears out of nowhere and kills you  gg go next  Yes  this game punishes you for using its main game mechanics in the only place it allows you to use it  In fact  «you have angered the gods» message can appear even if you are outside of the temple  some worm or spider decided to randomly ravage through the temple and youll be the one to pay for this   You got the Electicity Immunity perk  and then found a wand with a lightning bolt spell  Great  lets cast it… you are dead  gg go next  Why Thats because in this game lightning bolt deals explosive damage  Again  ilightning bolt deals explosive damagei  It deals electric damage to you only if you are submerged in water  and thats alright  but how the hell am I supposed to guess the former I can understand fire damage from lightning  but why explosion  what were they thinking  You got to Hiisi Base level  you are fighting enemies  you are getting through the level  you have 80 hp left  and… boom  you are dead  gg go next  Why A ruptured propane tank got fully covered by the falling snow and exploded right beneath you  Just a reminder that after this you should start all over again from the beginning  exploring the same caves again and trying to scavenge as many wands and health bonuses as possible  And by «the same» I mean literally the same  Level geometries are different  but level layout is always static  mines first  collapsed mines to the left  giant lava pond to the right  coal pits to the bottom  I do not know if someone finds it funny to replay the same mines for the 20th time  I do not   You got frozen in snow level and then some creature meleed you gg go next  since it is a one shot no matter how much health do you have   Temple of the Art  the second to last level  has purple wizards which cast polymorph on you  If you failed to dodge that one purple projectile that you wont be even able to see in most cases  then gg go next  you are polymorphed  you now have 1 hp and a very limited movement for approximately five seconds  Any other attack will kill you  including the next purple projectile  Again  a reminder that youve just spent a hour or two just to get here   The same can be said about the darkness projectile  I got lucky that it hit me right near the exit portal  but this one turns almost the whole screen black for  like  five or ten seconds  good luck dodging incoming projectiles or else gg go next   Have I mentioned that each time you are hit  youll be stunned for some time Coupled with the absence of the immunity frames after getting hit  you can easily get from 300 hp to zero in a latter stages if you are not extremely careful  This happened to me when dealing with some white flying enemy in the endgae  gg go next   I have no idea if thats a bug or whatever  but I got no «Victory» achievement after finishing the game for the first time  The game just closed and started updating to 1 0  I guess it was just a bad timing  but still  if the game cant kill you  itll find a way to «gg go next lol» you   If you read other reviews for this game  you might have seen people with 100 hours in this game who managed to beat it only once  but Ive beaten in twice in 12 hours  How If you reduce wands cast delay  recharge rate and mana consumption to zero  most likely with «reduced mana» modifier  «luminous drill» and that green bouncy projectile spell  youll get the Chaingun wand  It kills enemies extremely fast  but it kills frames even faster  enabling the games «slow motion»  Yes  performance of this game is my second problem  My PC isnt the best  in fact it is an older gen i5  but  you know  it can run DOOM 2016 with 60 FPS on highest settings  so why should 2D game be so demanding I have also literally no idea why it uses not all four CPU cores and not only one  but two I guess that physics can be parallelized  but not really Anyway  I fire this wand  game slows to approximately 15 20 FPS  I have plenty of time to react to incoming projectiles  last boss had zero chances against that cheese  But one time in the early game I was just choosing wands and the game suddenly slowed down to literally one frame per two seconds in the holy temple and never unfreezed  «gg go next»ing me again  Why this happened I have no idealist  In conclusion  if you like to lose your progress because of snow covered propane tanks exploding beneath your feet  then youll probably like this game  If you think that losing is fun and have 1000 hours in Dwarf Fortress  then youll probably like this game too  I wont be as optimistic as other reviewers if you dont belong to those

for their amazing work if you agree  Its sold at reasonable price  with a recent sale a few weeks before originally writing this on 20230225 at half off making the price even more enticing  It has a lot of similarities to Metroidvania titles  probably mirroring Terraria the most  but with an incredible sandbox in which you customize your own tools and weapons with the wand system  The depth of the sandbox is exaggerated by every pixel being simulated  and multiple tools the player can use to modify their world  The roguelike has enough variation to provide endless replayability  Theres even a mod to play the game with co op so you can enjoy it with friends  You should absolutely get Noita        and then mod the crap out of it  Save scum if youre frustrated  The truth is  this IS a negative review  because the review system asks Would you recommend this game to other players  and the answer is   no  I would not recommend THIS game to players  I would recommend what Noita can become  with modifications to it from passionate players  but not the Noita were sold  Its unpolished  with major bugs that directly interfere with the scientific gameplay this game otherwise encourages  because of things being inconsistent  or justified more by programming logic errors than by intuition or the emergent gameplay mechanics that Noita shines because of   Noita can become a game worth playing  So can Borderlands 2  Both share the attribute of requiring inappropriate amounts of effort from their players for the games to become what they should be already  I am part of the group of people that loves Borderlands 2  I have over 3000 hours in it  Ive played BL3 for over 1500 since then  and Ive come to realize that our relationship with BL2 can only be described as a form of Stockholm syndrome  I would not recommend anyone play BL2 without a save editor  as doing so requires a supreme lack of self respect  Likewise  I would not recommend anyone play Noita without save scumming or mods   Noita will have projectiles spawn inside of you when they shouldnt  from the other side of walls they arent meant to be able to pass through  from enemies that cant take damage because theyre too far away  The game thinks that means it doesnt need to process their collision anymore  despite that they can still attack  Just before writing this review  I killed the final boss twice in a row within a few seconds  while in a fresh run  because it came back to life after the portal meant to spawn upon its death had already appeared  Noita will leave harmful pixels in your path that you cant see  blending them perfectly with the background  and making little effort to provide an experience where what you see is what you get in those edge cases that are unfortunately all too common  Noita will have important objects  from simple Holy Mountain statues  to rare stones  simply clip through terrain into oblivion  never to be found again  Noita will crash and corrupt your save file  directly punishing you for investing time into longer runs  Noita will ask a lot of you  then give you very little  with the probabilities assigned to important resources designed to yield many poor experiences before another good one comes along   Noitas idea of difficulty is to have enemies that are either invisible  or so veiled by darkness  or so far away  or some combination of all of those  that you cant see them  sniping at you from well outside of your range  and with enough power to obliterate you before you can react  Its these enemies having reflexes that involve the player being shot literally the first frame they can have line of sight after rounding a corner  usually because they can skip their telegraph animations at will  Its having projectiles clearly meant to go in random directions just happen to always hit you from off screen at higher speeds than they normally travel  Its having a single pixel of poly or ice that spawned inside of you   and then the WASD spam escape system mysteriously stops working right when you need it most able to ruin everything youve worked toward  or giving you enemies from 4 stages ahead within the first stage  or starting you off with a flask of acid  a wand that runs out of mana immediately  and another that doesnt have enough ammo to dig through all the vines growing everywhere  just to spite you  Its enemies that spew many of the infamously dangerous pixels when they attack you  then bleed exponentially more of them when you shoot back  Its having dangerous tanks hidden in piles of snow  and electricity based traps guarding loot everywhere  even as early as the first stage   and thats not about the obvious traps with wires connecting to a power source  thats   opening a chest near liquid  The game is unnecessarily cruel  and not in a way that feels difficult  but in a way that feels disrespectful and toxic   For a game so heavily focused on experimentation  experimentation is often punished  with strategies that work well eventually no longer working  without explanation or change of circumstance  It really does not feel like the game is meant to be played as a roguelike  and comes across more like the tired old arcade formula designed to eat your quarters   Major milestones in Noita are achieved via concerning means  Advanced combinations of perks usually involve having an integer overflow  or exploiting whatever the hell the perk removal altar is doing  The length and value of runs is extremely constricted by the RNG  including for experienced and resourceful players  even before considering that worms may spawn and tear apart important terrain or anger various gods without any consideration of the players actions  For many bosses  every interesting mechanic that makes them need to be learned  instead of steamrolled by the same build as every other  is accompanied a cheap way they can ruin the fight and encourage the player to not bother with them until they can be defeated instantly  Its even more of a requirement that bosses be defeated quickly when kiting them involves a real risk of the boss getting bored  wandering off into some unfavorable terrain  and possibly even becoming impossible to track   especially if theyre randomly teleported away by an unlucky displacement spell  After all of that  youll get a run where an overpowered spell or series of them or reagent is available to you near the start of the run  so the rest of the run feels automatic and uninspired   The amount of spells  perks  and reagents to combine lets you experience a delightful curve of power growth  with seemingly endless fuel for creativity found in all of the projectile delivery systems  payloads  and special effects that may provide raw power  defense  or some other utility  Id be surprised if the game wasnt somehow Turing complete  with computers able to be built in Noita out of strange logic gates made out of an awkward arrangement of entities and pixels of terrain and fluids  I must reiterate how incredible the soundtrack is  and that you should definitely play and experience Noita   but Noita is a video game  not an album of music  It should be playable   and too often  it doesnt feel like it is  It does  however  feel like the games code is a whole kitchen full of spaghetti  Its needed an update for 2 years now  Make the friend boss tanky again ",2023-02-25,2023-02-28,False,45,7,0.636223554611206055,17,True,False,False

reactions  that can explode in a burst of colors and smokes is very satisfying  Unfortunately  Noita is also a bad game  with some severe balancing issues   h1The positive pointsh1  Before I dive into what makes Noita a bad game  I do want to points out what it succeeds at  Its a great physics engine  its a delight to see how liquids work together  its a delight to have an idea for a wand that combine various things together  and see that yes  it works like you intended and create glorious explosions on screens   Moreover  I like the overall world of it  even if I think it needed more guidance for new players to not get lost in stuff that is irrelevant to most of them   But as you can see  all of that is stuff that constitutes the outer shell of the game  The inner shell  the gameplay  has unfortunately too many bad aspects   h1Slow beginningsh1  Many Noita runs will end prematurely  before they can even begin in earnest    First because of the random starting loadouts  that are not properly balanced  For example  you get a random potion at the start  Adding a water potion was a mechanic added in Early Access to help players deal with the frequent cases of omg my character is on fire  But then they made the loadout random  and so you get a random potion  and that potion may not be able to extinguish fire  or may even be actively harmful acid potion      Second because there is just too much variations between randomly generated levels  Some feature a lot of good wands  health pick up  etc  Others will feature rare enemies that are tougher to kill  more likely to kill you   and yet dont provide any additional rewards upon killing  compared to the standard enemies   This makes for a frustrating experience for beginners and experimented players alike  as you already need to invest a significant amount of time before you can even consider that a run is started ie  you get a good starting wand  some gold and some decent power ups like health or a good perk   h1A very random experienceh1  Unfortunately  the randomness isnt gonna stop at the beginning  Im used to roguelikes and roguelike likes  those are genres that I very much like  but Ive rarely seen so much variations between runs  There is just too much randomness   To be able to have a decent run  you need to get at least a decent wand  a decent perk  and some decent amount of gold   The amount of runs that fail to provide you with at least one of those is unfortunately very high  Listing the number of things that can ruin a thing would take too long  but here are some examples   The dungeon will have some random variations that make it harder to explore   You stumble upon a pocket of enemies that deal so much damage that you need to flee to the next level and are therefore unable to get the goldwands you need  You will just simply never find a wand that is able to kill enemies fast enough before youre dead   When you get to the absolutely essential moment of choosing perks  youre offered only useless ones or worse  ones that make the game even harder  even after rerolls  etc     This is compounded by various bugs and or annoying behaviors of the game  like how sometimes enemies interacting between each other or the world will end with negative consequences for yourself  or even outright unavoidable death  or the fact that some stuff can one shot you in particular  electrified surfaces   A good roguelike like try to provide variation  but also has a generator whose numbers are properly tweaked to avoid too many extreme scenarios that make the game either too easy or too hard  Noita clearly didnt care to do that tweaking as you will sometimes have very lucky runs  but most often  very unlucky ones  where a good run comes to a brutal end through some random occurence   h1Wand tweaking is good  give me more of thath1  That random aspect is even more highlighted by the big mechanic of the game  the wand building   In the game  you find wands which carry spells on them  You can tweak wands to change the spells in them  so they interact differently   When youre lucky enough to find the spell components you want  and the wand that can use them  then you can make great great instruments of death that will carry you far into the game   However  the game doesnt offer you any way to safely test new spells andor experiment outside of the game  Moreover  most of the wands are shuffle wands  so you cannot control in which order the spells will trigger  which often resulting in chaotic behavior  And finally  wands also have various interactions with the world making things explode  electrifying surfaces  etc   creating even more chaos    All that chaos mean that you get pretty explosions  but it also means that most of the fun spells are also the most likely to damage or even instantly kill you  And that means that the best way to make it far into the game is to limit yourself to boring  but safe wands that have predictable  known and controllable effects   Here again  the conflict between the physics engine make some big damage wands  create chaos and the gameplay trying to survive a full run of a deadly roguelike like conflicts between each other   h1Conclusionh1  While there is definitely an element of skill to the game  and you will get better at it if you keep playing it  the overall feeling is that you get very few good runs  and a lot of miserable experiences in between  and that  ultimately  beating the game will require a lot more luck than you would expect from a properly balanced roguelike like   I played it to the end because of my completionist tendencies  but I didnt enjoy most of the time I spent in it  Its sad  as there are some very interesting aspects to it the world  the physics engine  the wands      but it needed much more work on the design and the gameplay to shape those starting elements into a satisfying game

enjoy a chill  and fairly short completionist experience then this might be for you  but for all the teasers of something lurking in the depths  DREDGE proves to be a surprisingly shallow experience full of potential that is left half baked  Its not a bad game by any means and Id more than recommend it on a sale  but the game tends to fall flat in both the fishing gameplay as well as its storytelling   h1Gameplayh1 Ill preface this by saying that nothing the game does is outright ibadi but rather its full of but s  so lets get the factual aspect out of the way first  You control your little fishing boat from a third person perspective  looking for fishing spots that can be interacted with through a short timing based minigame  Your inventory is a grid that contains both equipment as well as your catch  with some fish coming in wacky shapes that can be tricky to store efficiently  Theres a day night cycle  with a light sanity mechanic causing hallucinations and hazards if you stay out at night for too long  For the most part  this translates into cash which you use for upgrades and repairs  but the occasional quest can give you some unique upgrades  abilities or special pieces of equipment which feeds into the fish   sell   upgrade loop that is rather satisfying to progress through… at least for the first few hours of the game  When it comes to progression  the main mechanic extends your storage capacity and number of slots that can hold equipment which  in turn  provides bonuses to night lighting  speed  the ability to catch different types of fish or employ more passive fishing methods such as nets or crab pots  Sadly the system has the same lack of depth as everything else  ultimately   The map is divided into a central starter zone  with four other biomes and story segments surrounding it  This is evident from the get go and gives the map a weirdly segmented feel since each different area is only separated by a small stretch of ocean and the map is fully revealed so theres not much room for surprises there outside of maybe one sidequest which requires you to fish in a particular location  To add to this  the gameplay loop in all of these areas is identical to the tutorial zone  Fish might require a different rod  net or trap to interact with  but the minigames are largely identical whether its a typical shallows fish  a deep sea shark or youre dredging for upgrade materials  which ultimately feels like the limiting factor in progression  Furthermore still  three of the four areas youll visit only have one NPC who usually helps you deal with the rather underwhelming hazard in the area and the generic travelling merchantshopdock so they end up feeling quite barren and similar  Ironically  the first zone after the tutorial offers a bit more story and a threat that remains relevant in the area and requires a different gameplay approach so it feels strange to move from that to an area where the threat is almost entirely passive and immobile   You might also notice I didnt mention the sanity mechanics in detail anywhere  These hazards quickly lose their charm and boil down to a handful of mild inconveniences that can largely be ignored if you really want to fish at night  While there are fish that can only be caught in the nighttime  theres no other time pressure or mechanic that encourages you to take risks so even these mild inconveniences can be almost entirely avoided  Not only that  but most of these sanity threat cards are played out from the beginning of the game so as soon as you spend a couple of nights out fishing youve likely seen them all already and their impact as both a gameplay and storytelling mechanic becomes meaningless   Lastly a note on controls  I ended up using a mixture of controller and mouse to play because the inventory management is infinitely more comfortable with a mouse  and rather tedious with the controller  even if its fine functionally  On the flip side  controlling the boat definitely seems more suited to a controller although it seems to work fine enough on keyboard controls  They both worked together seamlessly so its just a side note I felt like mentioning   h1Storyh1 After that lengthy gameplay segment Id love to say something nice about the story to compensate  but this was probably the biggest letdown for me  especially the more I went through the game  The premise is a Lovecraftian setting where things arent quite what they seem and everyone is just a little bit crazy but they just dont do enough to push it beyond the most shallow of interpretations  The aberrant fish have fantastic flavour  descriptions and art but are ultimately just slightly more valuable fish you catch sometimes  Theres a short plotline at the start about debt over the boat you were supplied with but it goes away in a matter of a day or two  The NPCs offer side quests that make you think theyll go somewhere interesting then fall flat or lack any follow up  Deliver a suspiciously eldritch package to someone They just go away and the quest ends  Help an NPC build a house on an isolated island away from the other towns Its just another docking spot and theres nothing else to do with them  Most of these quests boil down to fetch or delivery and later on you barely even get those singular interactions anymore because of the lack of NPCs outside of the main quest line which isnt particularly deep and Im sure many people will figure out long before the ending   Im really torn here  The writing is good when it shows up  theres a lot of great set up for the world… and just not enough payoff  In the end  you could rip out all the Lovecraftian elements from the game and it would play almost exactly the same and thats the most damning point   h1Visuals  Audioh1 This is one of those games where the screenshots and videos give it justice  The low poly aesthetic isnt anything novel  but it works just fine to convey what it needs about the game and world  Its a competent style which also extends to the artwork of the characters and the design of the interfaces  both of which are highlights in my opinion  The fish designs are delightfully creepy  especially in the case of the mutated fish youll encounter  There are a few visual surprises as well as a nice distinction between the different biomes with the atmospheric lighting doing wonders to sell the setting in the first couple of hours of gameplay   In terms of sound design and music  theres not much I can say left an impact on me  but its all solid where it needs to be  assisting the atmosphere with the occasional hint and whisper that reminds you that things arent quite normal here  Good stuff  h1Completion  Replayabilityh1 Theres nothing you can really miss in DREDGE  and while the loop of fishing  selling and so on is enjoyable  it ultimately outstays its welcome in the process of finding every single fish and exploring every nook and cranny for sidequests  The games few surprises arent going to have any impact on a second playthrough so unless you absolutely love the gameplay loop Id say the longevity of the game is very limited at this time

game is shallow  DREDGE runs out of steam long before the game ends  The only way to avoid a letdown properly is to ignore the loop the game teaches you and race to end   The gameplay is interesting in the first couple hours  Theres some enjoyment in the fishing mechanic and the concern with getting back  But a few things happen to break DREDGE  by 40 or 60 through the game  First  youre likely to have so much cash or ability to get cash that youll largely lose the survival style mechanic  If you do need to fish in these those  its not hard but its far less fun because the complex fish shapes mean youll be dealing with less fun Tetris inventory management  This is particularly true in the last island with Crab Pots  You dont have to drop the Crab Pots far from a completely safe spot  but you have to make lots of trips because you cant fit them in your boat  and the boat will not help you sort these  But the Crab Pots are so much more lucrative than normal fishing for your effort that youre only going to do normal fishing because you have to for a quest   In the early hours theres a survival danger  but by the end of the second Island I was rarely concerned with getting to a safe spot at night  I would guess that 75 90 of the damage I got in the game was from accidentally hitting the shore  My boat was powerful enough that even as I kept getting power ups  other than inventory space I stopped noticing how things were getting better except when I was damaged  The games mechanical pattern of some of the more interesting power ups light light mean youll generally be at the level for the island  The only serious dangers were local environmental puzzles  I think I died twice during the game  and only once very early to anything other than puzzle type hazard   Many of the mechanics of the game seem meaningful but dont lead anywhere  One of the biggest wastes is any trashtreasure  These items are almost always not worth so much more than fish  By the late game the average clunky crab pot haul is worth so much more than these  Despite not having much value  you can only sell them if you travel back to the main island  Making a trip across the sea to sell them is not worth as much as any fishing  so youll fish if you need cash  On your ship they waste space   the only positive is that they can go into your stashstyle inventory without going bad  but as a whole this means you dont care   Similarly  there are many layers of power up which have more details than are interesting  The game doesnt tell you which upgrades you will need until you get to the right spot  so its very easy to get the fishing rodsnets you need for island 4 before island 3  forcing you to grind for upgrade resources  The research parts are particularly slow to find or purchase if youve wasted your quest rewards on the wrong upgrades    The similarities between many of the upgrades give the feel of looter shooter loot comparisons despite the very small number of loot items  The crab pots in particular are worst upgrade trap  You boats space for fish and the pots and the work of collecting the pots are a more important limit than the crab pot size and time  There were many pots left to choose when I finished the game  Upgrading the crab pots past where you need to  could leave you short of important resources  The same is true of nets  which have a sweet spot early and then become not particularly interesting  By the time you could buy the Heavy Duty Trawl Net you should be done needing it or likely playing the game   Individual secondary and side quests are the same repetitive actions with little story and less payoff  Collect these fish and Ill give you the red key  Some of the side quests feel like they should have longer chains  but they dont  For example  the game shows some promise with the Builder quest  which makes you think the builder will expand the world when you finish the quest  Instead the chain ends without further payoff  Many rogue likes have randomly quests with more character than the quests here   The story is a standard Cthulhu nothing plot that never reveals any surprise  Ooh spooky stuff  evil  why Im sure someone who studied the lore could tell me  I felt like I was given an unopened JJ Abrams mystery box  My character feels like an Eldritch Horror tabula rasa  Everybody else knows more about me than me  even at the end  Theres a choice at the end and then an anti climax and were done  Once youve collected the last Tri force piece it becomes clear you can just press one of the end game buttons whenever you want   In the later hours I spent with DREDGE and particularly at the end I felt a huge sense of disappointment  Little effort was spent on balance  structure  and story  Just the early mechanics and presentations   I waited for some more patch notes to see if there was more happening with the game  and theres nothing here which suggests its getting better  There are so many more complete indie

have something that totally makes sense in the jungle level just copied and pasted into the ice level  Also  bubbles  This game introduces bubble platforms and I hate them  Theyre inconsistent and rarely add anything to the level    Of the new enemies  the shield bearers are fine  the flaming sword guys and bosses are not  The flame goblins invalidate everything except the wizards ability to cage enemies  They cant be frozen by the thief  they have an attack that goes around the knights shield  and theyre too fast to allow you to use the knights hammer  On normal difficulty  this is not really an issue  On Hard  these enemies are basically disguised bosses  Not mini  or sub bosses  Full stop  Bosses  This segues to the next issue  the games actual bosses  They suck  You have three damage based boss fights  and theyre all variations on giant goblin  One summons mobs  which are annoying if you play the game normally  but can also be exploited to kill him  The final boss is more like a puzzle boss  with things to do in the room and multiple points of interaction  The physicshitbox of the weak points can be finicky  but overall not a bad encounter    The story is    unfulfilling  There isnt really enough there to be judged  and the devs are annoyingly cheeky about it in the forums  acting like their inability to answer a simple question is a literary masterstroke of ambiguity  Im not watching Rashomon  you pretentious asshole  just tell me what happened  That said  the dialogue  both characters and narration  is excellent  The fun exchanges between the characters are supported by great voice work    Like I said  pretty average  hovering around a C  but Id probably give it a B  because the concept is pretty good  The DLC D  on a good day  Its half as long  but still has the 4 bosses  Its rife with untested wonkiness some of which rise to the level of bugs  But the worst crime of all is that it completely abandons the philosophy of being able to finish a level solo with any character  As a truncated run through  Level 1  plain  rehashed boss fight  Level 2  cool laser reflection puzzles  some neat concepts for hidden rooms  overall pretty cool  Level 3  Awful  garbage  introduction of an instant death trap very cool s  The only positive is that once you know what youre doing  the level is mercifully short  Level 4  Mostly fine  but the imprecise platforming rears its head most viciously here  A new boss enemy is introduced  it has an instant kill attack very cool s  Also  the final puzzle sucks and is the most blatant example of slapping down those spitting plants I talked about earlier  Its just lazy  Somebody pointed out that the dev had at some point bugged the final puzzle  removing the Thiefs ability to complete it  and the dev acknowledged it with levity and then completely ignored it  I really feel your commitment to game design  jackass  Level 5  Holy lack of playtesting  Batman  The floating platforms in this level are physics objects  meaning they can behave unpredictably  This makes it the second worst level for imprecise platforming  The new enemy type goblin shaman is more time wasting bullsht  Level 6  The boss fight to finish the DLC is interesting in concept  but it was not given enough time to actually balance  Not only does this battle eschew the any character can solo a level  it takes it to the extreme because the wizard is completely useless  except as a means of reviving the other two characters on hardcore mode  He has no way to damage the boss and his skills serve no purpose in the fight    The story for Goblin Menace is basically meaningless  I guess its good that Amadeus loves his wife  And despite the fact that Zoya doesnt like Margaret  she still comforts Amadeus in her own way  I like virtuous heroes  so I appreciate these touches  I absolutely couldnt care less about the goblins  Theres some kind of backstory youre probably meant to put together from environmental clues  but it was so disjointed and had nothing to hook me    Now  the reason I brought the achievement is that without them  all the problems of Trine would be mere speedbumps  The design of the game allows you to infinitely revive and slam your head against any obstacle until you figure or grind it out  However  the Hardcore difficulty option disables that  Each character can only be revived once per checkpoint  and you cant jump back to the last waypoint if you get stuck or are about to die  This means that if all characters die  you must completely restart the level  Combine this with the fact that the achievement requires you to play on the highest difficulty with Hardcore enabled  and you have a recipe for disaster  The difficulties should be labelled Easy  Normal  and Bullsht  You die insanely fast  enemies have way too much health this goes triple for bosses  and the margin for error is minimal to nonexistent small mistakes almost always result in death  Now compound this difficulty with the limited revivals in Hardcore  and add in the fact that specific characters are necessary to complete certain levels  It also elevates what should be small bugs or minor annoyances to run ending catastrophes  It shines a spotlight on the games numerous flaws and brings them into sharp detail  The overly long levels  the physics hiccups  the slapdash platforming design  instant death traps and attacks keep piling into the con side and the list of pros is looking really thin    Thats the worst part  but the rest of the achievements arent much better  Most of them are filler for finding all the items in each level  Fine  whatever  But then theres achievements with ambiguous or misleading descriptions for fulfilling bizarre or quirky conditions  If this was an initial outing  it wouldnt be as bad  but it comes back to one of my first criticisms  the first Trine did all of this better  The incredibly bitter aftertaste from completing this game completely overshadows the improvements that have been made   EDIT  I forgot  the music is amazing  Skip purchasing this  and just get the soundtrack instead  The beautiful  soothing music helped keep me from bursting a

main game of the Shovel Knight series  Its about 8 hours of pure 2D NES talgia style platforming  And Im not sure how much I like it  Nowadays you can get tons of high quality metroidvaniasthis is not one and platform games with both pixel art and non pixel art  Not to mention there are collections of real classic NES platform games  like Mega Man Legacy collection  which costs half of this and often goes to discount to fraction of this game   If youre on edge about Shovel Knight I suggest getting the standalone version of Shovel of Hope   its much cheaper  But if you end up loving it you will have to buy it at piece meal prices and youll pay more overall  Too bad they dont provide discount on Treasure Trove if you own some of the games   Now  how was Treasure Trove It was OK  It was obviously a kickstarter game  You run into stuff that looks and feels like a stretch goal  Theres a level with faces of biggest money spenders  theres few bosses that come out of nowhere and probably were added as a bonus  The game ends up having a lot of stuff in it  but its kinda disjointed  The difficulty curve is all off  the first stages are the hardest  then middle game is a snooze fest  then end game is stress filled joy killing irritating machine of 1 block wide jumps in total darkness with knock back monsters flying around  Its never really that hard  but it does get frustrating at moments   I didnt like how Shovel Knight plays too much  Attacking anyone with Shovel gives YOU so much knock back you can easily knock yourself off the platform youre standing on  That makes fights where you cant jump real pain  slow  and just boring  Theres an armor that lowers this knock back  but even then its not really fun    You can jump at enemies pogo style  like in Ducktales  but most of the monsters are designed in a way to make sure youll almost never combo multiple hits  Theyll quickly dodge second hit too far for you to reach  or block their head etc  I would be fine with just some monsters doing that  or monsters later on  but I found myself almost never really being able to just have some fun  even in early stages  when revisiting them    You also have some magic items youll collect along the way  They are fun  and useful    Not as useful as alternate weapons in Mega Man 11  but useful enough  The issue is  they made sure you wont have fun unlocking them  When you find a chest with magic item you get a price on it  and you have to pay  If you cant pay for it on the spot you will be able to later find it in town    at increased price  It happened to me only once  I was few coins away  but it was very frustrating   This game has souls like system  where you have infinite lives  but you lose some of your gold when you die  The gold can be then recovered if you reach the same spot  In theory that is  In my experience this almost never works as intended  The balloons with gold fly off randomly  and often end up in places where you wont be able to jump without dying    or just unreachable even with best tricks  Theres one item that can suck treasures towards you  but it takes the same slot as potent healing potion  so its hard to carry around  Often youll die by falling into a hole in the most dangerous part of the map  and the cash will be floating where you died   with no hope of retrieval  Even though money doesnt matter that much in this game and you can easily farm it its really irritating to see your cash permanently lost in a system where in theory you should be able to get it back  Thats just one additional small thing to be frustrated with   There are also some stages that will make everything black  so you have to move in the darkness  And I dont know what they did with this effect  but whenever it was on screen it made me nauseous and I could barely play  I had to pause the game every few minutes in order not to puke  Similar to playing a VR game  but without VR  I dont think Im photosensitive  no other 2D game ever had this kind of effect on me in my 30 years of gaming   Or they add fast travel at some point    But its slower than actually using the map  so I dont see whats the point   At some points random 4 bosses will appear on the map  I dont know if the order is preset  but the first one I got was the hardest of them all by far  All other 3 were pushovers I defeated on first go  This game has other bad decisions  It has MM style boss rush near the end    but if MM can be excused by tradition    in this game boss rush really adds nothing and just wastes your time  Unless youre doing some kind of challenge run I guess     Well  I can see this is a fine game  and for some players it might be awesome  There are a lot of funny NPCs in town  theres tons of bosses to defeat  many stages can be repeated as bonus stages to gather cash  You have armors and skills to collect  Overall its not bad  but it took me some breaks before I forced myself to finish  Where for example MM11 I got trough in one sitting and couldnt put my controller away   Theres just something in this game play that doesnt mesh well with me  As I mentioned   start with Shovel of Hope standalone  I really wish I did  I would have saved money  I thought I would love the series  due to all the acclaim it has   I also tried Showdown mode  which is full fledged Smash bros like fighter  With story modes for all fighters  different fight conditions and so on  Its much more robust than Ive expected  and I had fun with it  Its very good  and I would actually rate it higher than the main game  You can select multiple colors AND genders for each character you can actually change genders of all characters even in Shovel of Hope  The thing is though    I have better fighting games that I will always run over this mode when I play with friends    There are 3 other story games in this  One contains the same levels  but different character  The two others are completely original  I think one of them is kind of card game I havent tried them  so I cant comment on it yet  This makes for a good amount of games in one pack  but Disney Afternoon Collection also contains many good games  and can be much cheaper  There are many other 2D platform games on Steam that  both oldies and indies  that could be better for you  Shantae is great  Gunvolt series  Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth  Momodora series  And many  many others to choose from ",2022-12-10,2022-12-10,False,5,1,0.482649832963943481,0,True,False,False

Before i voice my complaints i would like to list the changes that i DID like   The black borders have been replaced with a nice theme changing frame  A lot of bugs and glitches have been patched out  Combat update made a lot of weaker characters better  EXP is shared between ALL of your gang now  so you dont have to stick to a few members for the entire game  New campfire scenes between the party members are all fun to watch  They really add a lot of extra personality and soul to some of the party members  while also expanding on Brads character and lore  A bunch of the games new added secrets are cool references to LISA The First which the base games could have more of imo   Joyfuls new warlord abilities makes playing as Buddy a lot more fun   even if like half of them become kind of redundant once youve completed about 23 of the game  While i had gripes with the secret superboss in Painful both the pre and the post boss fight parts are probably some of my favorite parts from this update  especially the conversation that happens between two certain characters at the end of it  Its the only time a video game has made me feel an emotion like that since    Well ever actually     Now that we have settled on that lets get into where this definitive edition starts falling apart    While the game did fix a lot of bugs it also ADDED way more bugs on release  granted a good amount of them have been patched out by now but there are still a bunch of glitches mostly on the visual side  Despite being a literal 8 bit RPG Maker game FROM 2014  THE SAME GAME I COULD RUN PERFECTLY FINE ON MY CRAPTOP FIVE YEARS AGO  this edition SPECIFICALLY will have random FRAMEDROPS which will lower the speed for no reason  Damage done from DoT effects like Fire  Poison and Bleed wont show up in numbers anymore  this might actually be one of this games many glitches which may seem intentional for some reason    I understand having to remove a song if its entirely made up out of a copyrighted sound effect  but did they really have to slown down work harder too now All they needed to do was get a guy to make a grunt sound that sounds enough like the original one and just remake the song with that as the base  it would have sounded almost the same and nobody would have been bothered    I dont really give a shit if people call me a crybaby for this but removing the monkey sound effect for Salvations Black introduction basically gets rid of the entire joke  yeah sure its racially insensitive but this is literally a game about a guy coping with his little sisters suicide after she got raped  Im sure a race joke isnt the end of the world    The exciting new content is really shallow and honestly there really isnt that much new stuff that justifies replaying it instead of just looking up all the new content on youtube   Speaking about the new content  lets get into it because thats supposed to be the real head prize of this update isnt it There are three main quests well actually it really is only 2 but im gonna get into why thats the case now after all    At the beginning of the game you get teased about this secret treasure by Terry which upon finding and discovering it just turns out to be a manual on all the stuff in the game  I dont really have a problem with this in itself  i mean its Terry of course it wouldnt be that significant and i even enjoyed reading the manual that i got there  The real problem is that they put this in THE ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER OF THIS UPDATE  This wouldnt even be a problem if it was meant as a joke to hide the excistence of another quest in the game which would make all of this a nice suprise  but this is just a mean lie    The second new quest of this game lies right at the final part of LISA The Painful  before you head out on the main area  To sum it up without spoiling anything its basically some cool lore stuff with a 2 HOUR BOSSFIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT    The bossfight itself is actually the most unique fight in the entire game and introduces a bunch of original mechanics so i will give it props for that  What i wont give props for is that the bossfight itself is a huge slog the boss itself has a lot of damage resistance  Is immune to a bunch of status effects including but not limited to EVERY DAMAGE OVER TIME EFFECT  Has the highest health in the game and loves to use insta kill moves  This boss while being immune to so many status effects is hillariously weak to one of the most common ones however  so weak infact that you can cheese this entire superboss with just one party member that can utilize this effect and 2 good damage dealers    The third and final quest takes place in LISA The Joyful  this is probably the only quest that actually feels like a quest  The reason you are doing this quest in the first place is to unlock a new ending  so it must be good  The quest in itself however is more boring than youd think  its basically a fetch quest with all the items youre supposed to find being from LISA The FIRST  However in The FIRST item fetching was a fun core part of the game where you had to complete puzzles and avoid spiders to get all the items you needed  in this game  most of the item fetching will consist of you just spam clicking random locations and looking at a youtube guide   Seriously You have to jump backwards when entering Mr  Beautifuls stage You have to spam Supply Order a bunch of times and hope to luck out on getting your item You REALLY have to spamcheck a random corpse on Dices stage which you can only access when hes killed YOU HAVE TO WAIT 5 MINUTES IN A RANDOM LOCATION FOR A SQUIRREL TO DROP YOU A GOLDFISH Where is this even indicated  I know the way you get some of these items are supposed to be references to The FIRST but unless my memory is hazy i really dont remember having to do stuff like this  Anyways after collecting all the items and completing another puzzle with them you will get access to this games superboss    Seeing who who the superboss really is youd think it would be one of the most promising and fun fights in this game  but instead its just an unfair broken mess  If you pick the wrong move at the literal start of the round there is a pretty high chance you might just get insta killed  The boss is really buggy  using sleep bomb on the boss is only useful half of the time since it for no reason can still use certain moves while asleep  the intended way to beat the boss is to run away from it after not fighting for 20 turns You heard that right  they literally made a boss so bad that even the creators dont want you to play with it   After youre done with the fight you can go on with doing some other easter egg related stuff to unlock the secret ending  but only if you havent taken joy suprise So when you finally have met all the requirements for the TRUE ENDING OF LISA THE JOYFUL what do you get   Some extra dialogue between Buddy and Buzzo which is completely out of character for both of them turning Buddy from a drugged up barbarian warlord kid to lowtiergod and Buzzo from a sadistic avenger who is dying beneath the sins he commited to a selfish toddler with a mommy fetish  A new ending screen  A new post credit dialogue with an admittedly sweet message  Yep  all that effort for a sprite  some text  and some bad writing  But you know what I can forgive all of that  its just a free update  the base version is still there and a lot of the stuff i complained about is 100 optional  so why am i complaining  The price raise  The creators for this game somehow thought in

women  so the world has uniqueness to it  The battle system was pretty basic  essentially being the same as what Final Fantasys battle system originally was before all of Square Enix went insane   However  the games main flaw is its main character  Brad is not endearing  but neither is he interesting  He is a selfish  near sighted  obsessive psychopath with a single minded goal to protect his daughter  which puts him at odds with some of the things we can choose to have him do  At first  I was sympathetic to Brad since I thought I could understand him and his plight  But the more misery I trudged through  the more I realized that Brad is merely a construct to make us feel bad  not a character in his own right   Im not kidding  There is absolutely nothing to Brad other than his obsession with his adopted daughters rescue  his drug addiction  and his past with an abusive father  The whole thing about him being a karate sensei is only a convenient explanation for his survival during the apocalypse  He has no hopes for the furture  no wants besides survival and his daughter  no quirks  no oddities  absolutely nothing to separate him from any similar  more interesting characters   Further more  at times we can choose to have Brad self sacrifice instead of watching his party members get killed  This would  in a competent story  mark him as somewhat selfless  Yet spoilerwhen those same party members try to stop him from going after his daughter  he kills them in complete paradoxical contrast to his decision to save them spoiler We cant even choose to have him not  So which is it Is he the character I choose him to be or the almost villain protagonist the writers want him to be The writers want to have it both ways  but all it ends up doing is overruling the character I instilled in him through my player choices  If you have him make a morally sound decision AT ALL  you are effectively choosing to have him act out of character   This is not a fun game  This strikes me as one of those Alan Moore kind of games where the devs decided to see how far they can push you  However  what further undermines the game is the fact that these tough decisions at no point threaten Brads life directly  nor do they affect the course the story takes aside from whether or not you get the good ending or the bad ending   I know I may be going on and on about the writing instead of the gameplay  but thats because the game cares more about keeping its head up its own ass than it does being challenging  The ending has just as much melodramatic bullcrap as the rest of the game with the whole game being neutered so the devs can show you just how much of it they cooked up for the final scene  And  like everything else with Brad  it felt contrived and badly conceived   Because screw challenging  rewarding gameplay that has a satisfying end to your gathering of party members  working out battle strategies  or even leveling up  Much like with Brads character  the game strips you of your own investment and gives you a completely new set of abilities for your main character who then fights the final boss alone with ten million instant heal items and even more firebombs  ensuring that your only way to escape seeing the ending is either your own incompetence because all that stuff is practically laid at your feet in the area before the boss or a wanton desire NOT to indulge whatever hack wrote this crap  The final boss isnt even the main antagonist of the game  Hes just some guy who only got two cameos previously and who  like everyone else in the game  I found far more interesting and sympathetic than the main character   The main antagonist was also a load  Hes the one responsible for forcing you to make these tough decisions that the game pretends to have  Again  none of them impact the plot  just which ending you get  And just to make things worse  we NEVER find out what his deal is  why he was forcing Brad to take drugs  why he constantly wanted Brad to mutilate himself or someone else  or why the devs give you the option to fight him if he wields haxors  I checked his stats online hes maxed out in everything and there is no way to beat him short of grinding away until the sun blows up  This doesnt add to my despair  only my frustration and anger   Ultimately  this is a terrible waste of an interesting  humorous world full of cross dressers and bikers riding deer around while the Power Rangers get drugged up while fighting villains who have no idea what theyre even doing there  It is an emotionally draining  boring  yet also anger inducing experience that I have no wish to revisit again at any point in the future  And if this review has left you feeling angry andor bored  then you now know EXACTLY what to expect from the game   Also  theres a bottomless pit mechanic that adds absolutely nothing to the game and merely serves as additional annoyance for the player  I believe this is an effective metaphor for the games attitude towards gameplay ",2015-07-14,2022-01-23,False,56,6,0.535497963428497314,51,True,False,False

game was designed to be a downer   I feel bad talking bad about a game I got as a gift but I feel like it must be said  With all the praise the game gets I feel I must be the Devils Advocate  Also it may say Ive only spent an hour and half  But I played when my internet cut out for a while  Id say there should be about 5 more hours on that time  This is probably mostly just opinion but bear with me   Overall I personally dont recommend LISA  Even as a fan of the Mother series and its successors The charm doesnt seem to be there  I see much of it as flawed  Execution fallen flat  Many may like it but I feel people shouldnt play simply because of all the hype  IMO Be wary   The gameplay is my biggest gripe  It doesnt feel new  Yes its just like Earthbound but still there isnt as much polish  Shoving a metric butt ton of party characters does not an interesting rpg make  Obviously youre just gonna pick the best ones and leave the others sitting around like imperfectly bred pokes in the pc  There isnt much strategy to picking who to use its more of who can do the most damage andor heal the most  A good RPG gives you a handful of characters and tells you to make due   I know why they gave so many characters and its because it has to compensate for the pain Which is just another way of saying how many ways you can be screwed over by RNGeesus  Perma death is a thing and it can happen on a whim  Not like Fire EmblemXComValkyria Chronicles where you made a fatal error  Its because thats just how the dice rolled  The enemy did an insta kill move you didnt dodge or resist and thats that  It isnt common and you may not have had it happen to you but its there  If theres anything I know is that for me that one percent of failure is a very real threat with my luck  But simply put Its more like getting annihilated by critical hits in a Nuzlocke run   Then theres Joy addiction  Oh boy what fun it is to sit through a withdrawal  Every 300 frames5 minutes that you dont transition between areas the game flips a coin  This determines if any of your Joy addled party members go into total noodle arm mode  Pretty much reducing any physical attacks they do into someone throwing cotton balls  You dont get over it through time though  Its either by resting a risk depending on where you sleep or going through 20 30 turns in battle  It takes a mildy interesting idea of dealing with addiction through gameplay and turns it into a major inconvenience  Especially since you can work around it with special attacks  Ive had withdrawals from medication and I can tell you it sucks  But the way the game handles it doesnt drive it home  If it had actual symptoms of withdrawal like wooziness occasionally miss weakness halved damage or nausea sp drain as simple examples then Id be ok with it  However as it is  this is less like heroine addiction and more like having a piss drunk friend that you have to take care of  Yes I know the world is supposed to be unfair and that it was done this way to hammer that fact in but Its just lazy  I could go on for millenia about this but in short its just fake difficulty   Another aspect about having so many party members is the choice to save ones life  The game storepage seems somewhat proud of that  I personally havent done chosen against it because I am a goodie two shoes but at the same time I think that it would just be easier to plan accordingly so I can send off a weakling  Because Ive looked into it and there are no ill effects whatsoever  Most of the characters have little personality beyond their character design so one wouldnt feel torn about losing someone  This isnt like Mass Effect where a choice between Ashley or Kaiden must be made although Ive never liked either character But these are people you can learn to care for  Sacrifice is hollow here   The story is definitely slow  I do appreciate that it fills itself in through bits and pieces but the more it does it seems too simple and shallow  It is rather cliched imo  Especially in Brad  Hes got the best intentions but is much like his father  Classic apple and tree scenario  The abusive father thing is also there  What annoys me is that the father seems to just be an asshole just to fill the role  Right in the beginning it felt like he just had to hurt him  His reasoning barely held up  Having read up on the backstory his actions simply dont make sense  There major are lulls in the story as well where basically its just dealing with whatever shows up  And whenever anything does happen it just feels like its trying to be total grimdark  I assume the pacing is meant to keep the player from burning out however instead I started to dread the possibility of the next story event  Another problem is that some of the character interactions frustrate me  Although thats probably my personal gripe with a lot of tragedy stories shining through  In tragedies character flaws will always explode even in the most level headed man for no apparent reason other than to produce a negative outcome  I tend to sit on the cold logical side so its always a pain to me  Oh well not everything can be Hamlet    In regards to the humor its kinda hit or miss for me  I started to just turn off later on because I simply stopped caring for the jokes so I couldnt even give them a fair shake  I just wanted to get through the dialogue  Dont get me wrong I love dark humor  I have the entirety of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac which I would recommend for fans of this game  sitting on my bookcase but this stuff just couldnt jibe with me  Maybe it was too predictable maybe it was just that the tone didnt quite match  I just cant put my finger on it   If theres something good I could say its that the music can be pretty kickass at times   Put simply

within  Its quirky and charming and the music is FANTASTIC So  why the thumbs down  Because the endings took a great game and turned it into a confusing guilt trip that punishes you for playing   ⚠️bSPOILERS AHEADb⚠️  The plot starts off with our character  Red  having his arm stolen by another character  Blue  You dont know who Blue is  why he stole your arm  or what you have to do to get it back  As you journey through the world  you meet this likeable cast of quirky characters  from a killer bank machine to a goldfish who uses a hook as a lip piercing   They dont have quite the depth that the characters from Undertale had  but the devs nailed the vibe iperfectlyi  Especially with the fight themes   Your rival  Zigg  The foot stomping Grundall  The DD session with Green Mage  This game had charm  It had class  It was clearly lovingly made by the developers    But then you get your arm back  And youre told that the world is one of eternal suffering and boredom  That the beloved characters are actually imprisoned within the game and that its your job to liberate them    by ikilling themi  Your arm is the only weapon thats capable of such destruction    This could have been a fantastic plot twist This could have paved the way for a genocide run like in Undertale   I have no qualms with the iconcepti at the core    The problem with Everhood is  unfortunately  the execution    It is implied in SEVERAL places that killing is bad  The bloodied text on the wall when you pick up your arm  The lines that say dont trust the spirits  The general insane vibes that the Lost Spirits give off   The characters  themselves  fear death Of course they would So  its heavily implied that murder is bad  That  if you try hard enough  you can find a way around it   Being so heavily inspired by Undertale  Everhood maybe unintentionally strings the players that come from Undertale along  Making us think that we can find that happy ending isomehow i Even the first Absolute Truth makes this feel like the case  stating All is not lost   Naturally  my friend and I hesitated on killing  going through the door that would break our destiny  I cheered my bestie on I bought her Everhood and watched her play  I have a neurological condition that makes it hard for me to use the keyboard anymore   We spent probably an hour trying to beat Frog  And what do we get We get told that we should have just killed everyone and that were cruel and horrible for keeping them alive  basically  We got punished for looking for a better ending than everybody dies  At that point  we lost motivation to try another run    to get another ending  So  I watched and read about the other endings  instead   Several of them are dependant on RNG and things that would be nearly impossible to discover  alone  That is  several layers of RNG in non instructed locations   Then  theres the good ending   When you go through with killing everyone which  of course  is filled with MANY difficult battles  you eventually meet the beloved characters on the other side  They express their gratitude for being freed from their prison  looking forward to what might await them next The game gets somewhat philosophical  with the positive message of life being what you make of it  Youre thanked for playing and then the credits roll     But itheni the game says Come visit us again Everhood never dies or something along those lines  effectively undoing EVERYTHING you just worked for Imagine you just spent several more hours freeing everyone by killing them  good the good end  and now the game goes and implies that it was all for nothing  That  once you close it  all your work is undone   THAT  right there  is what ruined the game for both me and my best friend    If you choose peace  youre punished for leaving everyone to suffer   But if you choose violence  the world resets and theyre all still trapped What the heck  If I didnt like the game  I wouldnt bother making a review   But I genuinely fell in love with the world of Everhood and its characters  Im simply icrushedi that theres no way to actually SAVE them  I think Everhoods biggest problem is how the killing route is presented  While there are characters who say that its gotta be done  its still implied that youre a bad guy for doing it  That youre going to get a bad ending by going that route  That there IS a peaceful option   But there isnt  So  I think that should be addressed in game  somehow   If killing everyone is the true end  it needs to be promoted as such  Rather than feeling like a crazed homicidal murder spree  driven by these mysterious and very sketchy spirits    Heck  if Everhood had ended with Red regaining his arm and the loose ends just hanging there  that would have been better   ⚠️bSPOILERS ABOVEb⚠️  I guess my point to this review is to express that the game  itself  is awesome Its got great game play  awesome music  lovable if not 100 rounded characters  trippy visuals  an active developer  perfectly timed jokes    It brings back all the nostalgia for Undertale  Its a beautiful world  I just want to save it    The story having such a depressing ending  really made me

that at least some of the issues will be fixed and provide the experience that this should have been   You play as a puppet whos had his arm stolen and youre on a quest to get it back  You walk around  talk to people  and occasionally get in a battle  The battles have music in them and notes come at you in one of 5 lanes which you need to dodge until the song ends  This isnt a rhythm game  The notes arent coming at you in patterns to the music or anything like that  Occasionally the game provides a brief minigame instead of a normal song battle   This has a lot of problems  Enemies stand really close to your character in battles  Im not sure what the exact timing is  but once a note comes out  you have somewhere around a second or less to react to it  Youre not setting up or planning any kind of strategic moves here  youre simply reacting as quickly as you can to not get hit by whatever is currently flying at you  This inability to be able to see future notes can lead to the problem that depending on the direction you choose to go  you may accidentally pen yourself in and get hit  Its not a huge deal  but it is an issue and will lead to you failing on occasion  There will also be some battles where youre mostly going to be hanging out in the same 2 3 lanes all battle long   A minor issue related to the above is that the enemies show up at the top of the battle screen with various animations that play throughout the fight  Since you have to be so focused on dodging notes  you rarely get a chance to actually look at these to enjoy them  Theyre almost a complete waste  Its as though they were made for the enjoyment of watching someone play this rather than for the person playing the game   The difficulty is all over the place  I played on hard  but I guess the game is entirely the same as normal with hard making it so you only take 3 hits instead of 5 to die and you regen health slower  Once you get used to the quick reaction style gameplay  it gets pretty easy for a long while  There was a long period after the first 3 4 battles where I dont think I failed again until after Id gotten my arm back and some of the more difficult battles start occurring  though there are a sprinkling of easy battles in the late game as well  Probably the biggest issue with the difficulty is they run out of ways to make the normal battles non repetitively tougher and decided to resort to using artificial difficulty as a crutch  Expect occasional battles where words are covering up portions of the grid and hiding notes  or bright flashing lights prevent you from seeing  times the screen rotates  or stretchingmaking the screen wavyetc so you cant tell where you are in proportion to notes  etc   Also in regards to the difficulty is that winning some of the more difficult battles never really came down to me getting better  but simply that certain sides are far more difficult during certain portions of songs  There was one song where I mustve failed 15 times while on the right side  Then I thought to myself  maybe Ill try this on the left side when it gets here  Went to the other side during the portion I was having issues with and succeeded on the first try  Winning a battle youve been losing can be as simple as switching which side youre standing on during the portion youre having trouble with  which doesnt feel satisfying  Leaves you going oh  I shouldve tried that earlier instead of trying to persevere   The biggest weakness in this is the most obvious one just by looking it  It desperately  desperately  desperately wants to be Undertale  and fails in pretty much every way in trying to replicate it  Youre not going to care about the story here  The dialogue is mostly bland and the humor is hit and miss  typically more on the miss side  Probably the biggest failure are the characters which lack any real standouts or development  In Undertale  through either the story or boss battles  you got to know the main cast of characters  which resulted in your decisions having an impact  Here  well    theres Jerk Guy whos just kind of a jerk  Theres Greedy Pig whos greedy  Theres Sneezing Nosferatu who sneezes every time you talk to him and likes a certain video game  You have Blue Thief palling around with you all game long and I dont know that I can even begin to describe his character because Im not sure he actually has one   Considering this is trying to be Undertale  you should already have a good idea of what the game is going to have you make a choice about doing later on once you get your arm back  The almost entirely bland cast of characters and lack of story stakes means you dont care much about the decision you have to make   Another minor issue is portions of the game are moving along very sterile black backgrounds with some sort of dotted pathway that you have to follow  If you move slightly off this pathway youll be constantly crashing into invisible walls  Not sure if this was an intentional choice or whether they just werent creative enough to come up with something to fill in these backgrounds  but it is noticeably distracting and hurts the game   This is a rough one  Everhood is mostly pleasant  somewhat enjoyable  and has occasional well crafted set pieces  It should be more than what it is though and mostly fumbles the story  characters  and dialogue that should make this stand out  Its like playing volleyball  having someone set you up for a spike  but as you jump up  the ref blows the whistle to signal that play is dead so he can go take a bathroom break

flat   The highlights of the game are the battles and the music  Quite a few of the battle themes are great  and the combat is engaging   Though weirdly  the songs are kind of hard for me to remember when I wasnt playing the game  but when I was fighting a specific battle  I would think Oh yeah  this sounds pretty good While the combat is pretty fun  its sort of wonky  While enemy attacks come at you to the beat of the music  if you try to dodge to the music  youre probably not gonna win  Unlike Guitar Hero  where you have to push the buttons when the notes line up  you have to move out of the way of the notes  so it feels like youre going against the music instead of playing along with it  It results in a sort of an odd half rhythm game where the enemies have to follow the music  but you dont   Now that I got the positives out of the way  I have to mention what really drags the game down  the writing  characters  and plot  Im just gonna be blunt this game feels like it was written by someone who played Undertale  but did not understand why so many people found that game so charming and appealing  Its as if the devs made a checklist of Undertales superficial traits and features and said Hey  we can do this too  Like Underale  Everhood has a collection of odd  quirky characters  a meta narrative  and the choice to spare the lives of the characters or to kill them  But the problem is that Everhood takes these features and waters them down until theyre dull and boring  The first time you speak to any of the characters  you pretty much know everything you need to know about them  just from the first few lines of dialogue  While the characters of Undertale were weird at times   they had backstories  personalities  and relationships with each other  These traits made Undertales characters likable  sympathetic  and even relateable at times  Everhoods characters are so simple that most of the time they just seem like props to justify the battles  Its like theyre punching bags that talk and play music as youre whaling on them    There are some moments in Everhood that seem to attempt to convince the player to like and form a bond with the characters  such as the tabletop RPG sequence and the kart racing mini game  Problem is  these sequences do not add any depth or nuance to the NPCs the player interacts with  They pretty much act the same way they did when you first met them earlier in the game  The tabletop game really only serves as foreshadowing for a battle mechanic that would be introduced later  In comparison  hanging out with characters in Undertale gives the player insight into the characters personalities as well as backstory about the games world and pre story events   The games meta narrative seems tacked on and unnecessary  It doesnt even bother to ease you into it the moment you start a new game  a mysterious being talks directly to you  the player  seemingly for no other reason other than it can  The meta fourth wall breaks do not enhance the games story in any way  spoiler Near the end of the game  a character gets upset that the player has been controlling them  but this twist comes so late in the game with so little buildup  that I couldnt care less about this character  spoiler Again  the meta narrative seems to be here just because another indie game did it   As for the option to spare or kill characters  Everhood basically takes Undertales version of this mechanic and turns it on its head  spoiler Basically instead of killing being objectively wrong  in Everhood killing the characters is treated as the right thing to do and its how to get the best ending  The game tries to justify this by saying that immortality is bad because it leads to insanity and immoral behavior and that youre saving the characters from endless torment by ending them  Problem is  very few of the characters seem to mind being immortal  The number of characters that actually want to die can be counted on one hand  Instead  at the very end of the game  the characters seem to be retroactively happy that you killed them  saying things like At first I was angry that you murdered me  but now I see the truth  Thanks Now if the game had leaned further into the darker  creepier implications of immortal life  this could have worked  However  the plot  setting  and characters are so shallow and underdeveloped that I didnt find myself feeling sorry for the characters  I didnt feel anything as I hunted the NPCs down one by one to kill them spoiler  Overall  this game just feels like it was desperate to be the next big indie sensation  so it just picks and chooses ideas from popular games  removes the soul and appeal from said ideas  and awkwardly sticks them together  The vagueness of the characters and worldbuilding combined with the heavy handed references to Buddhism and reincarnation makes me think that the devs were hoping that a bunch of Youtubers would make theory videos analyzing every aspect of the game  which would bring more attention to it  I understand that the team that made this game is very small  but that doesnt really excuse being so shamelessly derivative  You dont need millions of dollars and a massive team

absolutely stellar  Barring one notable exception  every single rhythm battle looks and feels amazing  and the soundtrack is even better  Unfortunately  thats where my praise ends  There isnt an easy way to say this  and I dont want to be unkind  so Ill put this plainly  The writing in Everhood is not good  and Im going to talk about why   The first act of Everhood is a loosely structured series of goofy situations  sprinkled with fun rhythm battles  Via a central hub  which for unknown reasons appears to be closely modeled after the nexus of Yume Nikki  the player can access different parts of the world  This in and of itself is fine  I personally enjoyed the looser  more episodic take on an RPG  In each part of the world  we encounter the same core cast of characters  At first  theyre not so bad  They make some goofy puns  and seem quirky enough  Unfortunately  as the game goes on  you realize that this is all these characters have to offer   I would normally avoid making comparisons to Undertale or other indie games  but since Everhood so clearly makes homage to Undertale  I think its only fair to make the comparison  Undertale is emotionally resonant because over the course of the game  we grow to care about the characters  empathize with them  and understand their struggles and complexities  The characters and their reactions are what make the pacifist route so rewarding  and consequently make the no mercy route so harrowing  Everhood stumbles where Undertale succeeds because in Everhood  nearly ever character is defined by a single trait or quirk  One character changes his name every time you meet him  Another has sunglasses and is a jerk  A third sneezes a lot  None are ever given any characterization beyond these singular traits  The characters are not interesting  or complex  or easy to empathize with  which means that anything that happens to them throughout the story lacks emotional impact  spoilerWhy should I care about the choice to spare or kill a character that I know nothing about Why should I be sad when they diespoiler  In addition to the characters  I bring up Undertale because Everhood has very similar plot beats  spoilerAt the halfway point of the story  you are tasked with murdering all of the characters that you have met throughout the game  so that they may pass on to their final destination spoiler This plot twist fails to have the desired impact in part because the games philosophy is communicated poorly  and in part because it was released after the massive success of Undertale  At this point  players have seen numerous indie RPGs to play with the concept of mercy  and naturally expect spoilerthat killing will not be rewarded spoiler Everhood exists in a post Undertale world  but expects players to take the games edict at face value  It fails to clearly communicate the Buddhist philosophies that the story embodies  and as such players who are not familiar or disagree with these philosophies will feel cheated or confused   Worst of all  spoilerMortis Ghosts OFFspoiler already pulled the same twist that Everhood did  spoilerWhile OFF played the destruction of the world by the player for horror and Everhood argues that such an act is a good thing  knowledge of OFF and its importance in the indie RPG scene weakens the impact of Everhood immensely  Everhoods twist invites comparison with OFFs  and it fails  because the twist has been done before  and done better spoiler Its not that the twist loses value when it is not surprising  its that when the two games are compared  Everhood lacks any of the same emotional impact  spoilerIn one story  we watch a monster slowly destroy the world  a monster that we the player helped  In the other  we kill characters that we have no investment in  and no reason to care for spoiler  Finally  we need to talk about the worldbuilding  or rather the lack of  Everhood gates important lore beyond difficult challenges  thus ensuring that many players will never see it  What lore that one does encounter in a standard playthrough of the game is sparse  I have no real evidence to cite here  because the game provides so little  What is the world of Everhood like How was it created Why does it present itself in the manner that it does If these questions were answered  then the answers elude me   I read another review which argues that Everhood exists as a philosophical argument  rather than a fully fleshed out story  If this is true  I would actually argue that it fails in this respect as well  The game presents the viewpoint that spoilerimmortality is unnatural and essentially torturespoiler  which is a perfectly fine point to argue for  The problem is that because so many of the characters are shown to enjoy and be attached to their existence  this argument fails to resonate  There are only a few instances in which we are shown the spoilerhorrors of immortalityspoiler  and they all come after we have already made the decision of whether we will carry out the games will  Meanwhile  there are many in which we see the main cast hanging around and having fun with one another  spoilerOur actions feel cruel  rather than like a necessary kindness  because we have not been shown enough of a reason for them to be considered kind spoiler  Everhood is a game with fantastic gameplay  whose plot suffers from a lack of proper communication  as well as a reliance on tropes and twists that have been done by its forerunners  and done better  It invites comparison  and in my opinion  it fails  Im personally excited to see what Foreign Gnomes does in the future  though  Theres a lot of ambition and passion in Everhood  along with heart pumping battles and amazing beats  and the developers are clearly very talented  If youre someone who can ignore the story in favor of gameplay  then I highly recommend Everhood  Unfortunately  I cannot  and as such cannot offer a recommendation

gripes with this game  which are free to be debated  The first has MAJOR spoilers  so proceed with caution  The second is spoiler free   bMAJOR SPOILERS AHEADb  spoilerFirstly  the story it tells as well as the things it expects you to do are often quite conflicting   Lets start with world building   What is this world Where do we find ourselves  and why Who are the people we meet Why are things the way that they are  here in this strange void of numerous doors  We have very few answers at first  and the game does a good job of hanging them in front of your face  just out of reach   But the answers it does provide are not satisfying  At least  not to me  They may work for some other people  which I can respect  but I feel as though too much is left up to the fan wiki to fill in the holes and explain things you didnt catch the first or even second time around   Why do I have to kill people to save them How do I know there is  in fact  a world other than this one  which is where everyone goes when they die What even IS this world If there is another world  is there a real world How do I know Im not being lied to by the people telling me to commit genocide How did everyone get to this weird  funky place of lovable characters Why are WE here  and how did we even GET here Why is everyone taking the form of a DnD loving mage or a sneezing vampire or something else equally creative and hilarious Why cant I undo the ending changing action I just did that I didnt know prevents me from finding and collecting everything  thus forcing me to start an entirely new save and redo the tedium of getting to the same point again  There are indeed answers to some of these  The answers that are provided to the player  however  are quite limited  There is very little lore to find  And the little bits and pieces that you do happen to stumble upon only leave more questions than answers   True lore hunters could probably do a better job than me of discovering what is hidden  But for someone who often loves to find and collect everything  even if I dont understand 100 of it  I didnt feel any excitement from moving from one tidbit of lore to the next   Now allow me to talk a bit about the plot   About midway through the game  all the unique and lovable characters you meet are expected to be killed  as I mentioned before  Yes  killed  By you  Only you   Of course  you have the choice not to  But this is not the correct choice  The normal  expected thing to do is to kill everyone  Everyone  There are a number of endings  but following this murderous path is what you should do if you dont know what else youre supposed to do   Some may not be put off by this  since you do indeed save them by killing them  but I cant look past the utilitarian evil that is required to bring true peace to these souls  clinging to the lives they have built for themselves despite being doomed to an eternity in limbo   spoiler  bSPOILERS END HEREb  Secondly  the gameplay   At first  learning the game is fun and rewarding  and it lasts for a while  Youre allowed to tone down the difficulty at any time if it ever becomes too challenging   And it does  I stuck through the whole game  start to finish  on hard difficulty  because I am no stranger to challenging games and do  in fact  enjoy a fair amount of difficulty   Ive beat all of Hollow Knight  I beat Rain World and stuck with it  despite its brutality  which beat me down into the ground over and over again  I even beat all of Celeste and modded it for additional difficulty too   This games most challenging parts are most certainly not harder than some of the above things that Ive completed   But the time required to become fast enough  skilled enough  or precise enough to learn and become used to the patternless bullet hell it often throws at you  is not something I decided to invest in   This is not a rhythm game  despite it sometimes feeling that way  You dodge the notes of songs you do not play the game to the beat of the songs  This is a bullet hell game  and you will constantly be reminded of that   I want to enjoy the struggle of these harder challenges  I really do  But when the game expects you to learn the more difficult bosses of the game not from experience and adapting  but from blind trial by error  I get too frustrated too easily   This kind of learning and skill development is not fun to me  especially not after spending ten hours only to realize that everything I have already learned is close to worthless due to the ensuing bullet hell in which every moment is practically indistinguishable from the next  thus stunting my ability to develop my skills further   I will admit  the gameplay is  for the most part pre endgame  quite enjoyable  The music is fantastic  and it sometimes even gets stuck in my head because its so damn good  The dialogue is cleverly written  and it has absolutely made me laugh on a number of occasions   If this is all you care about in a game

within  Its quirky and charming and the music is FANTASTIC So  why the thumbs down  Because the endings took a great game and turned it into a confusing guilt trip that punishes you for playing   ⚠️bSPOILERS AHEADb⚠️  The plot starts off with our character  Red  having his arm stolen by another character  Blue  You dont know who Blue is  why he stole your arm  or what you have to do to get it back  As you journey through the world  you meet this likeable cast of quirky characters  from a killer bank machine to a goldfish who uses a hook as a lip piercing   They dont have quite the depth that the characters from Undertale had  but the devs nailed the vibe iperfectlyi  Especially with the fight themes   Your rival  Zigg  The foot stomping Grundall  The DD session with Green Mage  This game had charm  It had class  It was clearly lovingly made by the developers    But then you get your arm back  And youre told that the world is one of eternal suffering and boredom  That the beloved characters are actually imprisoned within the game and that its your job to liberate them    by ikilling themi  Your arm is the only weapon thats capable of such destruction    This could have been a fantastic plot twist This could have paved the way for a genocide run like in Undertale   I have no qualms with the iconcepti at the core    The problem with Everhood is  unfortunately  the execution    It is implied in SEVERAL places that killing is bad  The bloodied text on the wall when you pick up your arm  The lines that say dont trust the spirits  The general insane vibes that the Lost Spirits give off   The characters  themselves  fear death Of course they would So  its heavily implied that murder is bad  That  if you try hard enough  you can find a way around it   Being so heavily inspired by Undertale  Everhood maybe unintentionally strings the players that come from Undertale along  Making us think that we can find that happy ending isomehow i Even the first Absolute Truth makes this feel like the case  stating All is not lost   Naturally  my friend and I hesitated on killing  going through the door that would break our destiny  I cheered my bestie on I bought her Everhood and watched her play  I have a neurological condition that makes it hard for me to use the keyboard anymore   We spent probably an hour trying to beat Frog  And what do we get We get told that we should have just killed everyone and that were cruel and horrible for keeping them alive  basically  We got punished for looking for a better ending than everybody dies  At that point  we lost motivation to try another run    to get another ending  So  I watched and read about the other endings  instead   Several of them are dependant on RNG and things that would be nearly impossible to discover  alone  That is  several layers of RNG in non instructed locations   Then  theres the good ending   When you go through with killing everyone which  of course  is filled with MANY difficult battles  you eventually meet the beloved characters on the other side  They express their gratitude for being freed from their prison  looking forward to what might await them next The game gets somewhat philosophical  with the positive message of life being what you make of it  Youre thanked for playing and then the credits roll     But itheni the game says Come visit us again Everhood never dies or something along those lines  effectively undoing EVERYTHING you just worked for Imagine you just spent several more hours freeing everyone by killing them  good the good end  and now the game goes and implies that it was all for nothing  That  once you close it  all your work is undone   THAT  right there  is what ruined the game for both me and my best friend    If you choose peace  youre punished for leaving everyone to suffer   But if you choose violence  the world resets and theyre all still trapped What the heck  If I didnt like the game  I wouldnt bother making a review   But I genuinely fell in love with the world of Everhood and its characters  Im simply icrushedi that theres no way to actually SAVE them  I think Everhoods biggest problem is how the killing route is presented  While there are characters who say that its gotta be done  its still implied that youre a bad guy for doing it  That youre going to get a bad ending by going that route  That there IS a peaceful option   But there isnt  So  I think that should be addressed in game  somehow   If killing everyone is the true end  it needs to be promoted as such  Rather than feeling like a crazed homicidal murder spree  driven by these mysterious and very sketchy spirits    Heck  if Everhood had ended with Red regaining his arm and the loose ends just hanging there  that would have been better   ⚠️bSPOILERS ABOVEb⚠️  I guess my point to this review is to express that the game  itself  is awesome Its got great game play  awesome music  lovable if not 100 rounded characters  trippy visuals  an active developer  perfectly timed jokes    It brings back all the nostalgia for Undertale  Its a beautiful world  I just want to save it    The story having such a depressing ending  really made me

that at least some of the issues will be fixed and provide the experience that this should have been   You play as a puppet whos had his arm stolen and youre on a quest to get it back  You walk around  talk to people  and occasionally get in a battle  The battles have music in them and notes come at you in one of 5 lanes which you need to dodge until the song ends  This isnt a rhythm game  The notes arent coming at you in patterns to the music or anything like that  Occasionally the game provides a brief minigame instead of a normal song battle   This has a lot of problems  Enemies stand really close to your character in battles  Im not sure what the exact timing is  but once a note comes out  you have somewhere around a second or less to react to it  Youre not setting up or planning any kind of strategic moves here  youre simply reacting as quickly as you can to not get hit by whatever is currently flying at you  This inability to be able to see future notes can lead to the problem that depending on the direction you choose to go  you may accidentally pen yourself in and get hit  Its not a huge deal  but it is an issue and will lead to you failing on occasion  There will also be some battles where youre mostly going to be hanging out in the same 2 3 lanes all battle long   A minor issue related to the above is that the enemies show up at the top of the battle screen with various animations that play throughout the fight  Since you have to be so focused on dodging notes  you rarely get a chance to actually look at these to enjoy them  Theyre almost a complete waste  Its as though they were made for the enjoyment of watching someone play this rather than for the person playing the game   The difficulty is all over the place  I played on hard  but I guess the game is entirely the same as normal with hard making it so you only take 3 hits instead of 5 to die and you regen health slower  Once you get used to the quick reaction style gameplay  it gets pretty easy for a long while  There was a long period after the first 3 4 battles where I dont think I failed again until after Id gotten my arm back and some of the more difficult battles start occurring  though there are a sprinkling of easy battles in the late game as well  Probably the biggest issue with the difficulty is they run out of ways to make the normal battles non repetitively tougher and decided to resort to using artificial difficulty as a crutch  Expect occasional battles where words are covering up portions of the grid and hiding notes  or bright flashing lights prevent you from seeing  times the screen rotates  or stretchingmaking the screen wavyetc so you cant tell where you are in proportion to notes  etc   Also in regards to the difficulty is that winning some of the more difficult battles never really came down to me getting better  but simply that certain sides are far more difficult during certain portions of songs  There was one song where I mustve failed 15 times while on the right side  Then I thought to myself  maybe Ill try this on the left side when it gets here  Went to the other side during the portion I was having issues with and succeeded on the first try  Winning a battle youve been losing can be as simple as switching which side youre standing on during the portion youre having trouble with  which doesnt feel satisfying  Leaves you going oh  I shouldve tried that earlier instead of trying to persevere   The biggest weakness in this is the most obvious one just by looking it  It desperately  desperately  desperately wants to be Undertale  and fails in pretty much every way in trying to replicate it  Youre not going to care about the story here  The dialogue is mostly bland and the humor is hit and miss  typically more on the miss side  Probably the biggest failure are the characters which lack any real standouts or development  In Undertale  through either the story or boss battles  you got to know the main cast of characters  which resulted in your decisions having an impact  Here  well    theres Jerk Guy whos just kind of a jerk  Theres Greedy Pig whos greedy  Theres Sneezing Nosferatu who sneezes every time you talk to him and likes a certain video game  You have Blue Thief palling around with you all game long and I dont know that I can even begin to describe his character because Im not sure he actually has one   Considering this is trying to be Undertale  you should already have a good idea of what the game is going to have you make a choice about doing later on once you get your arm back  The almost entirely bland cast of characters and lack of story stakes means you dont care much about the decision you have to make   Another minor issue is portions of the game are moving along very sterile black backgrounds with some sort of dotted pathway that you have to follow  If you move slightly off this pathway youll be constantly crashing into invisible walls  Not sure if this was an intentional choice or whether they just werent creative enough to come up with something to fill in these backgrounds  but it is noticeably distracting and hurts the game   This is a rough one  Everhood is mostly pleasant  somewhat enjoyable  and has occasional well crafted set pieces  It should be more than what it is though and mostly fumbles the story  characters  and dialogue that should make this stand out  Its like playing volleyball  having someone set you up for a spike  but as you jump up  the ref blows the whistle to signal that play is dead so he can go take a bathroom break

take it seriously  so I sat down and listened   While its antics were mildly entertaining when it wasnt talking  whenever it opened its mouth it was clear that its thoughts were not fully formed  It simply wasnt saying anything compelling or interesting whatsoever  It didnt even feel like it was trying  It didnt feel like it REALLY had something to say  or perhaps it was not good at expressing its thoughts  or both  Even though I went into it expecting and ready to be completely immersed in its tale  I was left quite disappointed right at the start  to be honest  Whenever I wanted to say something in protest of how little was actually coming out of its mouth  and that what it was saying was not entertaining  it threw about 20 different colorful character designs at me and shouted HERE Arent you entertained now  Before I could even formulate an answer  it grabbed the back of my head  and slammed my face on the computer monitor  My eyes were forcibly glued to the screen while it gave me 50 different audiovisual trips in a row  with colours flying around everywhere  bright lights flashing constantly  and the screen being distorted  turning and turning    i     So yeah  in plain English if you are expecting a good story  or well written characters  dialogues from this game  stay away    If all you want is a superficial audiovisual trip  and many wacky character designs Note to the developers  Which do not equate to well written characters  You cant just give them a random wacky personality  such as SOMETIMES DOING WACKY THINGS LIKE SPEAKING ALL SHOUTY WITH CAPITAL LETTERS LIKE THIS  and call it a day  then knock yourself out  While I also greatly appreciate good music in games and music based gameplay  there are many indie games that focus on music that are among my favourites sadly  it was barely enough to keep me playing  and not enough to keep me impressed  Honestly  if the game instead went  Theres no story  lets just have a sequence of music battles  one after another  I would have been all for it  I can almost guarantee that I would have liked it better  if it didnt promise me a story at all  But if you genuinely try to tell a story  and fail  it reflects badly on the game  Especially when youre also purloining your games concept from THE most critically acclaimed indie game of all time   Even though the core gameplay itself is creative enough  the overall concept of the game is blatantly and shamelessly unoriginal  Im not exaggerating  you could have called this Undertale 2  and I wouldnt have been able to tell  I would have went Man  Toby Fox sure phoned this one in  What the hell happened Also  it straight up lied to me right in its store description by calling itself an RPG  which it most definitely is not  If this game is an RPG  every single game that has ever existed is an RPG  Yes  its THAT far from being an RPG  I had seen this game quite a while ago  and had initially passed on it  writing it off as an Undertale clone  In hindsight  perhaps I should have trusted my instincts and experience  If you consider Undertale to be The Scream  then  Everhood would be a crudely drawn caricature of it  almost like its mocking it  even though thats not its actual intention  Completely incidentally  I stumbled upon a streamer playing Undertale before I wrote this review  and I genuinely felt more emotion in a very short and random segment of a game I have already played and finished years and years ago Undertale  compared to anything I felt for any character throughout Everhood  even though Everhood is still fresh in my memory    I will not provide any context for this next part to avoid giving any spoilers  but it might still be considered a spoiler by some  so Ill tag it  spoilerA character in this game said You are not my friend  at some point  And I instantly thought  Youre godamn right Im not  I dont even know who you are   I couldnt even remember that characters name  I still cant  at the time of writing this review  so the character will have to go unnamed  For comparison  If a character from Undertale had told me the same thing  it would feel like my heart was being stabbed  Not to mention  the game blatantly going You liked our characters  right You liked this trip  right Wow  the feelings  am I right Surely you feel these feelings that we feel huh near the end repeatedly while saying wait  wait  not over yet  One more thing about every 10 seconds  made all this look even worse  spoiler   After halfway into the game  it seemed like it was going to make some actual good points about immortality and death  but it fell too short to deliver anything of substance in terms of that  too  There were some more small sparks of interesting ideas near the end that also  sadly  got drowned out by the rest of the poorly delivered writing  The premise of the overall story is actually ripe for good ideas a surreal trip through lands of immortals  SO much more could have been done with this  that its simply frustrating to see    spoilerWhen you deal with such subjects  you cant just write LIFE IS SUFFERING  and BUDDHA on the entire paper and call it a day  spoiler  I also recommend anyone whos tagged this game as Story Rich on Steam  to read just one decently written piece of literature in their entire life  Just one book  I hope Im not asking for too much  If your threshold for labeling a game as story rich is this low  it is clearly a sign of deficiency   Ultimately  its not a bad game  I would still prefer playing a game like Everhood over Hand drawn Indie

too harsh in this review  but its because I care  I wouldnt have played the game to the very end and left a long review  if I didnt care  I was actually  genuinely disappointed  I think this game could have been much  much better  But sadly  instead  it preferred to stay in the shadow of Undertale rather than take any big creative risks  while also making the terrible mistake of neglecting

were a little lackluster but that was mainly in the early game  later on there are some genuinely challenging boss battles that give u that sense of accomplishment after beating  some of the bosses had neat little quirks to them that I havent really seen much  like theres one boss that if you get hit will heal and regress to his previous stage  theres a lot of diversity in the combat that makes fighting fun  props to the devs for taking this simple concept of dodgingdeflecting objects and keeping it refreshing  uMusicu  even the simple beats were nice and funky and had life in them  and some of the boss battles had phenomenal music  especially the ones at the end   Cons uThe storyu  Before i go on a rant about the story i want to clarify  there were parts where I felt the pacing and dialogue were really well written spoiler i especially thought the part where you were roleplaying as a knight was actually really nicely written  all the characters in that segment felt alive for me in ways that i sometimes felt the rest of the game lackedspoiler  Now that I got that out of the way  its not hard to see that this game was heavily influenced by Undertale  and i can see them trying to sort of copy a similar take on the story  where deep truths are meant to be conveyed through the lives and fates of characters that the player has grown attachment to  there are a few problems with this execution though  the biggest is that there isnt really much time given to the player to get attached to the characters  in Undertale for example i feel like the pacing was done really well  big important characters got a lot of screentime and there were lots of moments where you felt connected to the character to the point where killing them actually hurt  Im not saying there werent characters ive grown to like or know in this game i can think of a few  but i never got attached to the world as a whole  there are characters I never even talked to where later on i suddenly am expected to have that same sort of emotional reaction about their fates  Usually in games thats not a HUGE problem  except the entire premise of this game depends on this attachment working out  so if you dont feel it  the entire thing falls flat  Like imagine playing undertale but without really much attachment to the characters  all those moments where you had to choose if someone lives or dies suddenly lose their weight  since you dont really care either way  thats kind of how this felt for me  dont get me wrong  this is a really tricky thing to nail down story wise so i dont hold it against the devs at all in fact i imagine that during the creation of the game and writing the characters the devs probably developed an attachment to these characters theyve worked on for so long since they have a fully fleshed picture of who they are in their heads thus  the story would work pretty well from their point  problem is  when some of these characters have less than four lines of dialogue in the entire game  you cant really expect the player to feel that way also  theres even this big reveal part in the game thats supposed to be important about a character that youre expected to care a lot about  but have literally only seen maybe like twice in the game before for a few moments talking about spoilerPinkspoiler  I could keep going on about other aspects of the story but id get into a lot of spoilers and this is the gist of it anyway uThe level designu  This isnt the main thing the game is selling so its not that important in my opinion  but it still felt like at some points there was a lot of walk in one direction in a void or if you go down this empty area of the map  youll find something moments that were kind of annoying but nothing too bad  there was this one moment that felt like a walking simulator spoilertrip to the castlespoiler i just wished that they could have been a little more nuanced with those kind of elements  uLagu  Warning for people like me who like to play these sorts of games in one run  make sure to save a lot  After a few hours of gameplay the game will start to considerably lag at first all the flashing lights in boss battles will slow down everything  and eventually even just walking around will be laggy  Its all fixed if you close and re open the game  but since you dont always have an opportunity to save  you might have to lose some progress  Again  not a huge problem but it did get super annoying in boss fights where timing was important and I hadnt encountered a save point in a while  uTHE ENDINGu  The ending was WAY too stretched out  Ironically in a game that is all about letting things come to an end  this game had a habit of purposely prolonging itself  Im pretty sure that there was at least an hour of ending content after I finished the final quest in the game that i felt was unnecessary  Like  there were at least three or four moments in the game where youd think itd be a good spot to end but then they would literally tell you but we should end this properly  shouldnt we and shove another boss fight sprinkled with what was supposed to be emotional story but for reasons stated before fell flat  Honestly i think it should have just ended when spoileryou defeated the sun everyone is free and thats that  I can see how stuff after that fits into the games overall premise but it doesnt work if youre not attached to the characters  ESPECIALLY the whole reveal about Pink  I barely even knew who Pink was before the reveal that i was more confused than anything  and the fact that now were supposed to care about Pink thus felt very forced spoiler  Other observations  The VFX is WILD  During boss fights expect you entire desktop to twist and bend and explode into a kaleidoscope of colors  Sometimes its a little too over the top where its annoying  Other times it fits well into the fight and actually becomes an element of the fights challenge  A few times they just seemed unfair  It was kind of a hit or miss though more hit than miss with how they were implemented  so its neither a pro nor con  I will say that the VFX during the flower pot dudes fight were AMAZING  loved that fight  The graphics are meh  They have their charm  they look like Undertale  I actually kinda liked the low poly 3D visuals that popped up sometimes  It was cute  some of the pixel art was good  it all got the job done but nothing to write home about   Closing notes I know im ultimately giving this a thumbs down and it looks like Im giving this game a lot of criticism  but Im being this critical because I feel like this game truly had potential to be something really great  honestly  if they had nailed down the writing a bit more for the characters and worked a bit on the pacing  this could have been a very impactful experience  It just all feels so unrefined  unfinished if you will  Its like reading an essay draft that is cohesive but still needs some rewriting and rethinking before the final  Devs clearly put a lot of love into this while ultimately I couldnt find myself connecting with the characters I could easily tell what theyre going for and that they tried   Each piece of dialogue had a bit of personality in it even inanimate objects had cute descriptions or normally mundane actions like saving had its own little fun dialogue  I have high hopes for these devs hopefully the success from this game will lead to having more resources to create a more refined game in the future that will iron out all of these issues Im having if so  I can tell that game will be phenomenal  this game isnt terrible  its just that there are a few huge negative things like the story and especially the extended ending such that I cant give this a thumbs up

is not meant to be considered fully objective  Ill do my best though    Seeing all the positive reviews I was really looking forward to the game  Sadly  Potential spoilers for Everhood and Undertale below  Direct spoilers for Everhood are in spoiler text   I know youre probably tired of Undertale comparisons here  but let me make another one  there are reasons Undertale went so popular  and one of them is how insightful it is  It points out many things  it comments on the choices you have made as a player   This game attempts to do the same thing  but fails most of the time  Most so called choices are made only in order to progress  spoiler I wanted to leave Blue at the beginning  but you have to take him with you for the door to open  Then some NPCs comment on how youre running around with an enemy  But thats not the most problematic moment like that  After getting the arm back  Ive discovered that almost all the doors were closed  and I had to kill NPCs in order to progress   So I went for the Forest Guardian  who literally stated he wanted to die  without touching anyone else  The Knight guarding the castle then proceeds to call Red out for going on a killing spree  Which happened after I INTENTIONALLY AVOIDED killing anyone but the guy wishing for it  I thought theres a way out of this  like a somewhat neutral ending  so Ive spent about an hour trying to get the Knight tired enough of fighting without hitting him  which obviously didnt work  spoiler  Moreover  the story feels barely stitched together  The premise truly was interesting  but after the weird stuff the game kind of started to feel like more and more of a mess  The supposed morale of the story so far feels out of place  dropped from nowhere  with from little to no motivation for the player to progress in a way the game wants them to   As for the NPCs  some characters with a few lines and a fighting sequence is all youll get and are expected to care about  There was a good bit though   the spoiler tabletop rpg moment was fun and somewhat relatable  I liked to see characters open up a bit  too  spoiler  Moving on to the combat mechanic   Which  in my opinion  is really good  What I didnt like were occasional too long fights and those where it gets repetitive spoiler such as Maze Monster and Purple Mage spoiler   The spoiler Maze Monster spoiler deserves some special recognition here  as a barely avoidable  repetitive and difficult to get rid of fighting sequence which is literally the same every time  spoiler It seems like the red buttons wont work while you still have the after hit invincibility frames  so good luck no hitting the line when they appear spoiler It would have been cool to have a run by default setting  for which I went to check the menu   turns out you can get drawn into a fight right from the settings  Could be a bug though   What also messed up some encounters for me is the whole set of screen changing effects  Theyre interesting at first  but not while youre trying not to get hit  They  too  get repetitive    Moving on to locations design  Id point out some of them are needlessly empty and long  There are some interesting riddles though   On the good side    PS controller support   Photosensitivity settings   Most fighting encounters so far   The soundtrack  which is nice and fitting  and adds even more to already nice fighting mechanics    Some riddles   Post full playthrough UPD     I strongly recommend you turn Image sensitive on in the settings even if you arent  It severely reduces the number of  imo  unneeded distractions and flashing lights in fights    The best battles in the entire game are those with the least screen tearing  Some closer to final battles have a lot of of artificial difficulty in them due to previously mentioned screen whatever effects     I got some mid fights framedrops even on exceeding recommended system requirements pc    It felt like some NPCs were there just for the sake of the games morale  with barely any interactions with them  Even the seemingly important characters have very few dialogue lines    As for the late game story  it didnt really seem making sense to me  Characters occasionally contradict themselves  and the entire thing still feels wrong  even more after the way too long ending  The so called morale is just there  take it or leave it  spoiler youve always had the option to quit sorry  I dont remember the exact quote spoiler if you disagree  Theres a moment where a game asks whether you want to keep on doing what you were  and takes a no for but you must  Its not a game about choices that it so much pretends to be  spoiler It also occasionally breaks the fourth wall with no consistent understanding of whether the in game world knows about the player or not  spoiler  UPD2  newly added replay battles feature is great  I liked most of them and revisiting sure is fun    Unfortunately  Id go with a 410 overall  It would have been a great game with a more coherent story ",2021-06-01,2021-10-29,False,7,0,0.552733838558197021,0,True,False,False

IT IF YOU ONLY WANT A RHYTHM GAME  IT IS A BULLET HELL GAME   This review contains slight spoilers  Nothing that actually spoils anything  but refers to issues in the later parts of the game without saying what they are   for instance  bugs  If you want to be completely  10000 blind  do not read this review   Edit  Updated review  now has major spoilers but they are marked and labelled if theyre a major spoiler or not              Summary  Everhood is a decent game that I would recommend to those DESPERATELY wanting a undertale esque game that has semi fun characters and new gameplay    however  if someone asked me who didnt care for Undertale  I literally wouldnt be able to give an answer  The game is amazing for the first half  but falls flat in developing story  characters  and develops an issue of relying on trippy visuals instead of adding interesting gameplay gimmicks or making unique battles   Another edit  reading other reviews defending the game saying it stands on its own from DeltaruneUndertale   yes  Undertale comparisons are valid  When starting the game its immediately apparent how similar they are concept wise  Sure  the gameplay and theme ARE different albeit the theme is basically just the opposite of Undertales   like the exact reverse but theyre both semi satiric games with a cast of goofy characters although Everhoods fall flat in development  spoiler with something MOREEEE hidden behind it that becomes apparent in the second half  spoiler Not actual spoiler but players who want to be 100000 blind going in wont be happy Like  if you took a checklist and compared the games story  they would have the same checkmarks    thats not to say this is a clone  but it is VERY MUCH so derivative of UndertaleDeltarune   Pros    Decent lore  albeit not amazing    Fun gameplay    Amazing writing in the first half    Good music    Visuals are impressive    Mostly memorable cast of characters    Custom content means lots of hours of playtime   Cons    Minor spoiler  doesnt really spoil anything specific  spoiler Later half of the game on the first playthrough has some cheap shock value moments  Later half also has incredibly weak explanation or buildup to events  spoiler    Music is pretty good  but extremely unmemorable save from a few tracks  Almost laughably  I only remembered three tracks even when theyre played again later    Visuals are good and perfectly fine in almost all fights  but 4 fights gave me major eyestrain and 2 of those made me extremely nauseous  I have never had issues with flashing lights or distortion effects besides a little occasional uneasiness besides this game    Infuriating bugs towards the end     Overworld graphics 80 of the time are literally just black backgrounds  dots as a path albeit inaccurate and either some matching plants to the era or housesdoors  For instance  later in the game  theres a beautifully sprited house interior that makes me question why all the other interiors are bland and dull    Character writing becomes terrible and boring in the second half in favor of an underbaked story that isnt built up to  Characters suddenly lose their memorability if they have any and suddenly know everything about the world with no buildup  spoiler Three characters who were simply goofy earlier become seemingly omnipotent and know everything about the past and the main character in the final 10 minutes with no explanation  spoiler Minor spoiler   spoiler Unexplained spirits who know more than you do And give you power to fight And kill What It came off to me as simply the creators wanting to power up the protagonist wo committing to developing a source of power  spoiler Major spoiler   One area is built up to with collecting pieces of a door and is literally laughably pointless and graphically horrible   Protagonist develops random unexplained powers such as telepathy and the enemy has unexplained or elaborated powers to be able to counter these   Story significant battles are laughably easier than minor foes   Gaps without music meant to be eerie but just make the already unalive looking world feel worse   Random part in the first 30 mins of the game where the protagonist goes into a dream like sequence and literally makes no sense at all   spoiler The twist that Red is actually Pink and is just a puppet literally is the most boring twist ever with no lead up    we dont even know who or what Pink is before the last 10 minutes  and have only heard of them once where we didnt know their name    I thought they were just meant to be a battle effect LMAO spoiler Major Spoiler  Spoilers  Talks about end of game  doesnt say what happens story wise but describes some visuals  gameplay  and bugs  spoiler I have never before played a game that went from a 810 to a 410 in the final segments of it  but this game is a first  During the final 30 minutes give or take of the game  gameplay becomes repetitve   although it represents the games mechanics  it becomes battle segment after battle segment with trippy effects over and over  The effects  although impressive and quite frankly beautiful  become nauseating  One segment caused me a headache that lasted for 45 minutes  Devs werent kidding about flashing lights  but for some reason decided to amp them up to the max in the last hour  Its basically non stop lights and colors  along with the screen distorting  both making gameplay annoying where if you die you have to replay a dialogue filled fight and sickening  One part  I died a few times since it was tricky and had to repeat the most nauseating segment of the battle twice due to the lack of checkpoints in this extremely long portion of the finale  This isnt even the worse part   the game ran INCREDIBLY up until the last hour  when conveniently the game started experiencing major crashing  It doesnt help that the game lacks a quicksave feature at checkpoints   I had to redo 1 fight twice  which took somewhere between 15 30 minutes total  and then I got to the final battle  beat it  and the game froze and crashed right before the credits scene  As of this review I still havent gone through and finished the game  but I plan to attempt it after posting this  This is also a multi playthrough game and I hope this issue doesnt persist for those endings  I dont have a weak PC either   I havent had issues with crashing in literally any game besides this one or games where I added tons of mods as a joke to see how fast I could make it crash  I dont know if anyone else has had an issue with this  but it happened to me  spoiler",2022-03-07,2022-03-07,False,8,0,0.547856748104095459,0,True,False,False

like it did mine  you wont go wrong picking it up on sale  For the price theyre asking  its a totally fair experience  However  it isnt one much worth your time  I was disappointed with Everhood  My wary presumptions were only confirmed by the time I completed the game  It simply isnt more than the sum of its parts  and never rises above wanting to be Undertale  The game is too bound by what inspires it to truly stand on its own and become what it so desperately wants to    Before I get crap for saying what most people probably think when first seeing this game  I want to explain this  Now  taking inspiration alone is not a knock against Everhood  I went in looking for a stand alone experience  but this game never bears anything unique to itself  Its so eager to leave a lasting impression  and borrows so heavily from what inspires it  that its impossible to ignore how derivative it is  Despite this  the game is so eager to wow you that it undermines its entire premise  and that might be the weirdest part about the game  Its desperate   The narrative is bare and basic  yet the game tries so hard to convince the player of deep  introspective meaning to the point it gets irritating  while simultaneously trying to entertain with quirky and random characters  The game incessantly tells the player  You just had a weird time Hyuk Wasnt that memorable and nuts  echoed several times by the characters in this game  The worst example of this is near the end  where you go through like  4 final battles and literally every one of the 30 characters tells you You had a weird time Ill never forget this and the over dramatic music plays while the game tries to make you believe you give a shit about any of what happened in the barren 7 hour game  Its such a wash  Come on     The characters do not matter  plain and simple  30 sets of sprites who at the end of the day feel like props as a means to an end and nothing more  Theyll say a random quirk or quip  youll go into a reverse Guitar Hero battle with them  and then walk into the next random dark room  find another weird looking sprite  and rinse and repeat until the credits  That is the extent of the characterization you get in this game  and it isnt enough to sell me on this grand tone the game is flailing about with   It blows  cause there was real potential here  I feel like its another case of a fundamental misunderstanding on why someone likes something   why they take inspiration from a source  Its like the devs just looked at Undertale and assumed the meta narrative was the reason it blew up and connected with so many people  Despite everything else in the game  Undertale gained traction because of its characterization WITH the meta elements  I dont even like Undertale or its writing  The characters in the game had side quests and dialogue that was quirky and stupid  but at least gave context to their world and relationships   it served the story and the gameplay   Everhood just lacks in meaning on all fronts  yet still tries to shoehorn in a world ending  meta  big importance narrative in that vein anyways  only to end with a message of lol  do what you want  There are no truths  Maybe thats the whole point  but I didnt need to pay money  and sit through a shallow and shameless game to be half assedly told that   If Everhood was a confident game with focus on what it wanted to be or say  this would be a non existent issue and probably a memorable and fun game for me  Think about it  The devs could make a music based world to give context to the battles  or make it magic    like they kind of half attempted    Anything They could do anything with this games story and premise  and they just did Diet Undertale  Whee   The game play and music is there  and its solid  but it all gets overshadowed by the derivative and counterproductive narrative and bad writing  By the end of it  I was getting real sick of being told how to feel about this imitation game    Only for the end credits to LITERALLY give me a message from the developers asking for emails on how the game made me feel    Are you KIDDING Jesus Christ  This only cemented in my mind that the guys who made this game were just desperate for a reaction  attention   anything  and yet again  it has the exact opposite effect  Had the devs been more aware  resisted outright begging for validation  and cut out the patronizing writing on how the player should feel about the game  its possible people could come up with their own interpretations    Unfortunately  as the game is now  I can only walk away interpreting the game as a half baked  shallow imitation of greater things that have come before it  thinking Damn  they REALLY wanted to be like Undertale

personally think this should be a positive or mixed reviewed game not an overwhelmingly positive reviewed game  There are people who I would recommend this game because clearly  a lot of other people enjoy it but I personally expected more out of it  Maybe its just me but I will explain in detail anyway    Story  The concept of the story is very good and has never been done in any other game I played The best part about the game is in fact the story  However  the storyline doesnt flow the best because of the lack of character development and character building    Characters  I dont typically have a separate category for characters in a review but to understand the mixed bag in the story it will be necessary  The characters are not only a part of the story they are in a way THE STORY without spoiling anything  Though the story itself has a deep concept   the characters   do not  I felt a connection with maybe two characters and that is generous  Each character just feels like a funny or comical NPC the devs created  There is no character development at all with any characters until the very end when it matters least meaning kinda late for players to care for these characters  Plus even saying that the end had character development is generous because there wasnt necessarily a change from the characters but rather from the circumstances  The characters themselves are what hurts the storyline  even though  the concept of the story is amazing  Essentially  if the player ended up caring  relating  and empathizing with the characters then the story itself would have been 100x better and more interesting   Gameplay  Its mid  Lets be honest its not the best  No  its not bad but its not close to the level of Undertale which was the clear inspiration for the game  The battles are very different and incorporate music   not rhythm believe it or not  That was a MAJOR bummer  Rhythm beat games are really fun and addicting but having your enemies in the rhythm instead of the player feels wonky  especially at the beginning when players first learn how to control during battle  However  its still fun and enjoyable but could have been improved  Also  THE CONTROL MECHANICS TO PHYSICALLY RUN IN THE GAME ARE SO ANNOYING   Atmosphere  I didnt care for the atmosphere that much  For the longest time  you dont even know who you are exactly let alone what type of world you are located in  This just made the game feel empty without real meaning at the beginning  So the beginning just felt like you completed empty tasks and the battles that were done just as hoops you had to jump through to kill some time until we finally got to the meat of the story as to even where or what we were doing in the first place  Its all just average and I have no real connection to any level in the game nor did I want to dive further into any arealevel  In fact  if I missed something and had to go back   ugh   didnt like that because the exploration felt like a slow drag   Visuals  They are actually really unique at times  There are some really nice lighting effects and graphics during the battles that make it look really intense imagine if it was a rhythm based game but the visuals during the actual exploration are not great  Unlike the game Undertale  this game doesnt blend together the battle visuals with the exploration visuals very well  So there are times the visuals can look out of place   Soundtrack  There is no way I can avoid talking about the soundtrack as it is a music styled game  Its all sadly forgettable  This is a letdown from a game that focuses on music  Not too much to say about the soundtrack other than that  Perhaps it wouldve been better if the characters had much more distinctive sounds or if the game itself was rhythm based  However  the main reason they are pretty forgettable is that they nearly all fit within the electronic genre category of music which is going to be a hit or miss with players  For me  it was a big miss and to be sure I didnt enjoy the soundtrack rather than the game  I tried to listen to the games top played songs on Spotify and just couldnt enjoy them without gameplay  It is kinda sad but funny but my favorite two songs are in the trailers and my third favorite song is played by a trashcan monster character   nope seriously he may be trash but hes good with the guitar   Price  I dont suggest purchasing the game unless its on sale  The lower price is worth the wait   Streaming  This game was practically made for streaming  Its very fun to watch others play much more than it is to play it yourself  Unlike the player  the viewers can watch the NPC that the player is battling as it dances and talks all while the player is just trying to avoid the attacks that the NPC is throwing at them  The game has lots of things to catch a players eye with how it tries to act like the game Undertale  how they bring Genos Super Mario RPG doppelganger as the playable character  how they incorporate giant beat music to the core of the game  and a giant twist ending for people to freak out about  This is also a likely reason for the high reviews because the game itself can be a giant bandwagon that people enjoyed watching and so they purchased  reviewed  but never beat the actual game   Conclusion  Its not a bad game  its actually a decent game  However  during my first playthrough I quit the game two hours in to read the only negative reviews hoping I wasnt the only one not loving the game so much and to see if others had similar thoughts as I did  I was glad that I wasnt alone in thinking it was a decent game but not great  I originally was blinded by the overwhelming amount of positive reviews again its not a bad game but its not great which made me believe this was another must have game  However  the best part of the game doesnt happen till the player is 75 done with the game  ONLY 31 OF PLAYERS at this time ACTUALLY BEAT THIS SHORT GAME ACCORDING TO THE ACHIEVEMENTS ON STEAM Such a low number of beat achievements yet such a high review rate The game isnt bad its just mediocre  and I believe if my expectations were set correctly I would have enjoyed the game much more  With all this in mind if you think you are still interested then you should get it because its still decent   Score

store steampowered comcurator41363546 Fruit N Doggie ReviewsFruit N Doggie Reviews url so you can be updated whenever I post a new review quote h1Overall Rating   Mediocre ★★★☆☆h1  h1First Impressionsh1 Undertale UT is an indie game that left a huge impact on the internet  and I was initially hesitant to assume Everhood EH was a knockoff  However  its clear this wasnt just inspired by UT  but copied its homework  Just to list some examples  theres the font used for dialogue  replacing traditional combat with something unconventional  the character thats obviously WD Gaster  amongst many other parallels  Either way  it looked interesting  but I had no idea what I was in for    h1Gameplayh1 EH is described as an RPG  but thats not really the case  Its true youll wander around the environment  speaking with NPCs  doing a fetch quest here and there  and battling foes  However  theres no equipment or items to manage  nor is there XP or gold to earn  so youll never gain levels or more HP  I consider it an adventure game  built around a unique combat mechanic   When fighting an enemy  the battlefield takes on a UI similar to Guitar Hero  with the grid of five columns  Instead of playing notes though  you stand on this field and dodge sound waves  both darting left and right  and hopping over them  Since you arent actually playing the notes  the music isnt inherently useful for avoiding projectiles  as you often dodge large portions of them entirely  I wouldnt say youll want to ignore the music per se  but focusing on the visuals is key to EH  instead of syncing up with the beat as you might expect   https steamcommunity comsharedfilesfiledetailsid2414469213 h1Controlsh1 Theres the option to either play EH with a controller or keyboard  and I opted for a controller myself  Throughout the game  itll show prompts for different moves  some of which arent always available  For instance  reflecting attacks  If playing with a controller like I did  youll find that there are numerous options for the same inputs  For instance  you arent stuck to only one choice for dodging back and forth  able to choose from three areas on the controller  Because of this  youll find it useful to experiment with the set up that will suit you best     h1Storyh1 Having beaten EH  I frankly dont know what is going on with the story  Theoretically  I could present my interpretation  but Id have to spoil all of the strange turns it takes  and know I didnt find all of the secrets  They may reveal more about the setting and whats at work here  However  though I found elements of it interesting and at times startling  most of it doesnt have the impact I think the developers were striving for  For instance  NPCs kept saying how tremendously difficult the task would be  and that none should have to bear such a burden  Regardless  what they wanted me to do wasnt some heart wrenching chore  but was generally pretty easy to manage   The main reason for this stems from how many of the NPCs just arent very interesting  EH included a pair of goofy brothers  clearly meant to be Sans and Papyrus  but they arent nearly as charming or memorable  To be fair  I quite enjoyed the Green Mage  as he walks a fine line of being completely insane  However  he was one of the few exceptions  as most are much less engaging than him  Potentially  playing New Game might add more nuance to the characters  or finding some secrets could open an unknown avenue in the plot  Overall though  I think its trying to be more edgey and meta than it really is   https steamcommunity comsharedfilesfiledetailsid2414469151 h1Visualsh1 The game includes a warning for those who would have problems with flashing lights  and it does so for good reason  Many battles make heavy use of distorted visuals and bright  flashing lights against a black background  Im fortunate to not have epilepsy  but even then  the developers should have restrained themselves  They went overboard with these effects  When in battles  your eyes will be cast towards the lower half of the screen to dodge notes  so its easy to ignore or miss what the enemy is doing  and in some cases saying  If you can multitask though  youll read their banter with you  and see how they move with the music theyre putting out    h1Sound Designh1 Despite not being a traditional rhythm or music game  the soundtrack is still a central element to the game  and is something EH delivers strongly on  Theres a decent variety of genres and styles to establish different tones  which tended to fit the NPCs well  One I recall liking a lot was the trash can with its Spanish like song    h1Prosh1 🌟 I quite liked the battle mechanics in EH  though I was disappointed the few times I wasnt able to retry a section after failing it  However  it gets even better in the second half  when every NPCs song displays another layer of meaning to it due to a new mechanic that opens up  Its rather clever  honestly  🌟 If youre struggling against an enemy  its possible to adjust the difficulty after losing  Theres a wide range of difficulty options as well  so it should support most skill levels    h1Consh1 ❌ Theres a flashback scene for the main character that seems really instrumental to the story  in part because the setting is unlike anything else in the game  However  it reveals essentially nothing because it ends before anything happens  which is so frustrating  ❌ Every so often  the game has unnecessary pauses that drag on an awkwardly long time     h1Tipsh1 🔍 Youll need to use both forms of movement to properly avoid incoming notes  However  dodging is emphasized more  as many notes are too high to be jumped over anyways   🔍 Certain patterns can corner you  so if possible  youll want to stay towards the most open areas  Later on in the game though  youll be required to steer into attacks     h1Final Thoughtsh1 One of my main issues with the games presentation is the sense that it did bizarre things at intermittent times  not for any meaningful reason  but simply because it could  The incident with the incinerator is mindbogglingly over the top that I have no basis to comprehend what it was trying to convey  and things like that kept happening  I feel like I have an unsolved jigsaw puzzle  still too early in the process to know what it is Im working towards  while lacking faith that the box contains all 500 pieces   Tinkering with the meta aspects of a video game can be enticing for gamers  yet there needs to be enough of a concrete basis for them to stay entrenched in  I cant dive into the world of EH because its foundation isnt well established  Part of me thinks a group of people tried replicating the success of UT on a surface level understanding of it  missed the point somewhere amongst all their bizarre ideas  and just went with it  The general public largely disagrees with me  loving EH in spite of being an obvious copy cat  Youll likely enjoy the music and portions of the gameplay  but I dont recommend the game due to flaws in its story and lack of originality   table tr thPC Specsth thPerformanceth tr tr tdRyzen 2700 RTX 2070 16GB RAM ADATA SSD

fine enough on normal or even hard difficulty without ever having to worry about the issues I will list here  Note  I played this game blind on the difficulty above normal  no permadeath  for my first playthrough  with the intention of a NG on highest with perma  Ive been making solid progress and not really felt like any challenge has presented itself Im at around chapter 15 The game is just not quite there for me  Here is why  tldr quality of life  The first reason the learnability and minutia  They provide a massive encyclopedia that occasionally gets updated with an entry but not often not only is it poorly organised but so much relevant information is missing or wrong  Half the terrain types like townscape  shadows  swamps dont have an entry at all  They dont tell you how any of the terrain types affect movement of any movement types other than an offhand comment in an unrelated entry that says paraphrased modifier from 3 to 2 4    of what cav infantry It clearly wasnt both   it was barely either because those werent concrete costs  Roads give road bonus and high ground gives high ground they spent the effort in putting together a 200 page encyclopedia but dont bother putting information in beyond abstractions  Same for half the unit buffs and tech tree tech  Youre told that cavalry get to take half movements after actions like attacking BUT this half movement appears random  sometimes giving only 2 squares or 3  or 4  from an original of 89  Terrain at starting point or ending point or during the bonus move doesnt seem to have any bearing on this but who would know if it did Weather is basically not explained at all  Treasure chests are written as though you could pass through as many of them as you had movement but half the time it randomly ends your movement  If I had played with permadeath I would be tearing my hair out  For something that involves so much inherent min maxing as I will cover in a later section this is unacceptable  Youre an RPG maker game not the Witcher stats and gameplay is your medium of expression   Nowhere is this told to you that you must micro manage your characters growth throughout their entire lifespan  Stat growth seems to be based off the base affinity I mean in common English  not the mechanic of the same name of the unit as it levels up noone tells you this by the way  They even make a note in the tutorial that levelups are only allocated rather than locked  implying some sort modularity and freedom when building units where you can at any time tear down a fully levelled unit to its base form and respec it  This is ENTIRELY  BLATANTLY untrue  Stat gains through levelling are done  in simple terms  based on the specialisation of the class they were at the time of level up  with higher grades having stronger growth  If you grow a guy for ages as a STR character  or even couldnt upgrade them because you lacked materials and you overlevelled them in the meantime  then want to swappromote to a fully developed SKL character  they will have severely gimped themselves    Its hard to micro your units in this way too  as that UI is completely janky  You can only choose to view individual units in the encyclopedia where they tell you what each unit evolves into on their own page with MASSIVE sprites you have to scroll down rather than in a table or something  or see the units in the class change menu  In the class change menu  you can promote or demote classes but you cant see things that arent in the immediate nest stage of the growth tree of the current class NOR CAN YOU EVEN SELECT THOSE CLASSES TO PREVIEW STATS AND ABILITIES FOR UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND PREREQUISITE STATS TO UPGRADE TO THAT CLASS  In order to see a map of relationships you need third party guides  note that this is especially important because you levelling actions matter from the very first moment  Even if you didnt want to optimise stats on you men  even finding out what can level into what is a chore   Movement and general squad building is super weird where type is based of majority characteristics  meaning optimised cavalry squads only need to have enough horses for 51 of the units to be mounted and the rest to move alongside them  Maybe this works if you take the squads to be abstractions of massive formations but as is it just feels immersion breaking   There is lots of stuff like what Ive already written  This game has insane praise on steam  Honestly if they had a mostly positive review I might not have batted an eye  But I expected greatness from this game  It is fine  playable  even fun  But it doesnt have the polish in quality of life I would expect from something overwhelmingly positive  I dont like how I have to jump to forums or dataminers just to figure out basics of the game like movement and movement cost   and I am NOT a stranger to complicated rules I assure you   Ive uninstalled because I feel like my current run and planned runs are now a bit of a waste of time  Because of how terrible the mechanics are to learn  even if they updated this  and I heard about it  I dont think I would even have the desire to pick it back up and learn

you the stats or name of the unit youve selected to rearrange within the squad nor the unit theyre replacing     You cannot change the leader within a squad  so if you want to class change the current leader  you probably have to disband the entire squad first since youre going to be class changing them down into a non leader class on the way to the class you want    There is no way to see what attacks a class can use from a units status screen or the class change screen  You have to navigate out to the tutorial menu and scroll through all available classes  then select the class and scroll to the bottom of its description in order to see that information    It may seem weird to lead with interface gripes  but Id argue one of the core joys of this game like Ogre Battle is optimizing  pulling squads apart and letting a badass generic unit who has been with your leader since day 1 lead their own squad because theyve quietly developed an unexpectedly huge leadership stat  Alternatively  realizing a rogue has weird stats and would be more effective class changed to a soldier or vice versa    h1    Difficulty    h1 The default difficulty is very easy  which drains the fun out of managing the army  Whats the point of all that optimizing if you can stomp everything without it  Regarding Perma Death as a difficulty lever  I love perma death in almost all games  but it feels very out of place in this game since all targeting in combat is random  Since you can still revive for almost no money as long as you do so before the chapter ends assuming the map has a temple  perma death mostly just slows the game down as you queue your squads up to revive before finishing a map  Also  in a game where the joy is watching everyone grow organically  having the faceless generic units become literal cannon fodder while the named units spoilerbecome godsspoiler and have invincible plot armor really highlights how juvenile the story is   Unlike Ogre Battle  placement within the squad doesnt impact what attacks a class uses  which is a bit disappointing   The tutorial mentions that morale only grants Free Actions to player squads  but I have seen enemy units take free actions as well  Bug Artifacts that increase capacity get a buff from the tech that reduces the cost of equipping artifacts  but 0 cost artifacts are unchanged  Bug   h1    Story    h1 2 out of 5   Which is probably be too generous  by chapter 19  I was too embarrassed by the story to keep playing and uninstalled the game despite still feeling hooked by the squad mechanics     Looking at the Metacritic ratings  I seriously question the standards of the reviewers  Im not sure how anyone out of their teens could rate this story a 35  much less the 45 several gave it  Did any of these people actually play Ogre Battle  Tactics Ogre  or any of the other games that preceded this in the genre   Writing ranges from mediocre to insultingly bad  Several scenes serve little to no purpose  Most characters feel paper thin  which makes the support conversations absolute cringe  I kept trying  but had to skip through them more often than not  Midway through the game  after youve been spoilereffortlessly crushing everyonespoiler there is a tedious scripted loss chapter spoilerthat ends with your character being killedspoiler  From that point on  the plot and script get progressively worse    It really does feel and look like the RPG Maker games I wrote back in high school 20 years ago  The main character is the worst kind of Mary Sue  and it only gets worse as the game progresses  with them literally spoilerdescending from the heavens to deus ex machina the whole plotline  but only once every other character has decided to sit down and diespoiler  Utter rubbish    And Im ranting now  but sometimes  at important times  basic details make no sense and completely undercut the narrative  Example   spoilerAt one point the remaining protagonists make a last ditch effort to break into a sewer beneath the enemys stronghold  all in order to teleport one character to a holy mountain somewhere  This makes no more sense in game than it does here   there are no teleporters or mention of any of this until moments before this mission begins  The mission is based on a scrap of paper none of them can even read that theyve been sitting on for 2 years  Ok     But it gets worse  just after seeing character 1 on the mountain for days  we see another character somewhere else far away in an unexplained scene    then  days later  without explanation  that 2nd character also shows up on the distant mountain somehow    He sits down with the first and gives up  an indeterminate amount of time passes    and then baddies show up as well For some reason  THIS exact moment is when the main character returns as a god spoiler It was all a pile of insultingly pointless breaks in continuity  and the fact that this was a climactic story beat wed spent 13 of the game waiting for at that point made it unbearable  They took a reasonable if too easy game and absolutely cratered it   I desperately wish theyd gotten a more mature writer to better complement the fun gameplay systems   h1    Summary    h1 In short  this game has a core system that is extremely addictive  but it lacks the sophistication in game balance  writing to make it something I can recommend   Would I play  recommend a sequel with improved interface and balance  written by someone else  In a heartbeat ",2022-08-11,2022-08-16,False,71,2,0.803882300853729248,12,True,False,False

am  so here we are  Ill be focusing on the gameplay and story bits of it since I feel I can elaborate on that better  Other stuff will be very briefly touched upon   There will be some unmarked story  event spoilers  so the TLDR is  solid gameplay marred by poor balance and a continually decaying and predictable story with flat characters  If you can ignore the story part of JRPGs  then go for it  If you cant  dont  Or wait for a sale   h1 Gameplay h1  Symphony of War combines Fire Emblem and Ogre Battle abbreviated SoW  FE and OB for brevity by combining squad building and management of OB with the personal growth and hero character leads of FE into one SRPG  You will form squads around individual hero units  with some of said heroes clearly having a preference for which style of squad they prefer i e  Barnabas has a trait to reduce cavalry unit cost  Experimentation is still heavy encouraged and rewarded  and you can have a ha  moments when crafting a squad that you really like or find out is very effective in certain scenarios  Resources used for unit promotion are part of a shared pool that is refunded if you downgrade anyone  which can be done at any time  so you are free to keep trying out different things   When entering a mission  the map style and layouts remind me of Genealogy of the Holy War FE4    they are fairly large in size with smaller objectives to capture throughout the map which gives you resources to be used later or during the mission  The missions with confined  linear maps have a clear focus on what needs to be done on the chapter  so you arent distracted with other side objectives  On the larger maps with locations that are out of the way  usually markets or resource nodes  it is worth your while to go for them   Battles play out automatically when you enter combat  so you are not assigning your individual squad members individual attack orders  You can  however  give them a general tactic to follow  These range from focusing the enemy leader  to attacking units with lower HP to get them out of the way faster  This can start out annoying  especially against enemy squads with heavy units in front that the AI will be forced to fight first before any backrow  but there are units to circumvent this and tactics to get around it  Certainly a learning experience by doing it  and its satifying to learn  The gameplay flow feels good and clicks quickly  Its ease of play will arise quicker to those who are familiar with FE and OB  but newcomers to both will still find this easy to slip into  Theres also a handy dedicated turbo button that speeds up the entire game   My gripe here  however  is the difficulty curve  The games intro sequence of missions lend themselves well into the typical layout of “tutorial first  then we let you swim a bit”  The missions here are balanced nicely and provide enough to think on without completely berating you like a child  When the second half of the game starts  the difficulty then goes from “this is a bit tricky” to “this is ridiculously easy” like a whiplash  Your cast of main characters become i literal gods i and gain powers in accordance  This includes map wide dances extra turn for one unit  AoE damage  5 range teleport  etc  Your other units at this point will also be quite strong into the mid to late game and will be able to handle most situations beyond the ones where you just arent paying attention   The undo mechanic also is in this game  For those in the know  this is equivalent to Milas Talisman or Divine Pulse from FE Echoes or FE3H  Im not going to beat on the fact that its here but I i will beat on the fact that this game has it as an unlimited resource  while the other two games at least give it some limit in use  i The main difference in SoWs rewind mechanic is that you cannot rewind an individual move  and if something terrible happens on the enemys phase  tough luck  However  you can just rewind your own turn infinitely until you get the perfect RNG or the perfect scenario to play out  or just rewind the whole mission like nothing happened  While a frustration saving measure  it also removes all agency of protecting your units and valuing your moves when the safety net is just one button away and has infinite uses  With the aforementioned dip in difficulty  you probably wont use this for any problems  but probably because you mis clicked a move and need to re do it   h1 Story  Characters h1  Hoo boy   The story definitely feel like an FE script that reads poorly  It starts off harmless enough  you are a lord with blue hair even in charge of putting down a rebellion  The entire scenario gives off “are we the baddies” vibes  especially when the prime minister in charge of it all looks the part  It follows very standard beats until  again  the half way point  when your character is executed by the totally not evil prime minister and then resurrects as a god avatar  They are re introduced doing a bunch of anime “totally cool” things  acting out the fantasy of that kid at the playground who keeps getting cool powers to not lose their make believe fight  It wraps up by getting the gang back together  killing the bad prime minister  then the big evil demon who was “the real baddie all along” shows up and you beat him up in space or something  If you have read the story for or played FE7 or FE8  you have read or played a better version of this games story  Whenever anything happens to these characters it always falls flat since I do not know any of these characters long enough to care about what happens to them  One of the big “uh  ok” moments I had was when they decided to dump the big twist that Jules is the rightful heir and king to Sayunaa  and Narima was meant to find him  This is… never hinted at whatsoever  There is one passing remark which Narima tells Jules to keep himself safe shortly after you recruit her  but its written as if its because shes looking out a fellow countryman  They try very hard to get you to care though  The rest of the cast comes off fairly flat  There are a couple that remind me of FE derivatives Jules → Wolt  Cybil → Serra  in concept   Big killer for me are the “support” conversations that units can have  Usually in FE titles  they start at “C” rank where they get to know each other  and then grow to either an “A” support where they are close friends  or sometimes “S” rank where they are in love and get married in the end  In this game  that doesnt happen  Characters will interact multiple times feeling like they are stuck in “C”  while other times  one character will talk to another i one singular time only  having never interacted in plot or otherwise  i then suddenly be madly in love and bonded  Abigail and Zelos support is the huge red flag for this  These two characters never interact and do not even know each other  but they have ONE conversation where Abigail asks about Zelos exploits as the previous Champion of Zanatus and when he starts talking about murdering innocents and soldiers in droves she thinks its “really hot” and just wants to bang  And Zelos response is “bro  sweet”  Fuckin yikes   This is what killed this game for me  The gameplay continued to get dull and easy while the story never really took off the runway  By the end  I was holding the turbo button going “lets get this done already” so I could file the game away  The music is fine  Sprite work is stellar  Art is… okay   All in all  its a solid game with solid gameplay that starts to taper off with iffy balance  and the story never really takes off  It feels very safely derived of its inspirations  leaning for the worse  Again  if you can ignore the story in JRPGs  go for it  If not  wait for a sale or just… dont

fine enough on normal or even hard difficulty without ever having to worry about the issues I will list here  Note  I played this game blind on the difficulty above normal  no permadeath  for my first playthrough  with the intention of a NG on highest with perma  Ive been making solid progress and not really felt like any challenge has presented itself Im at around chapter 15 The game is just not quite there for me  Here is why  tldr quality of life  The first reason the learnability and minutia  They provide a massive encyclopedia that occasionally gets updated with an entry but not often not only is it poorly organised but so much relevant information is missing or wrong  Half the terrain types like townscape  shadows  swamps dont have an entry at all  They dont tell you how any of the terrain types affect movement of any movement types other than an offhand comment in an unrelated entry that says paraphrased modifier from 3 to 2 4    of what cav infantry It clearly wasnt both   it was barely either because those werent concrete costs  Roads give road bonus and high ground gives high ground they spent the effort in putting together a 200 page encyclopedia but dont bother putting information in beyond abstractions  Same for half the unit buffs and tech tree tech  Youre told that cavalry get to take half movements after actions like attacking BUT this half movement appears random  sometimes giving only 2 squares or 3  or 4  from an original of 89  Terrain at starting point or ending point or during the bonus move doesnt seem to have any bearing on this but who would know if it did Weather is basically not explained at all  Treasure chests are written as though you could pass through as many of them as you had movement but half the time it randomly ends your movement  If I had played with permadeath I would be tearing my hair out  For something that involves so much inherent min maxing as I will cover in a later section this is unacceptable  Youre an RPG maker game not the Witcher stats and gameplay is your medium of expression   Nowhere is this told to you that you must micro manage your characters growth throughout their entire lifespan  Stat growth seems to be based off the base affinity I mean in common English  not the mechanic of the same name of the unit as it levels up noone tells you this by the way  They even make a note in the tutorial that levelups are only allocated rather than locked  implying some sort modularity and freedom when building units where you can at any time tear down a fully levelled unit to its base form and respec it  This is ENTIRELY  BLATANTLY untrue  Stat gains through levelling are done  in simple terms  based on the specialisation of the class they were at the time of level up  with higher grades having stronger growth  If you grow a guy for ages as a STR character  or even couldnt upgrade them because you lacked materials and you overlevelled them in the meantime  then want to swappromote to a fully developed SKL character  they will have severely gimped themselves    Its hard to micro your units in this way too  as that UI is completely janky  You can only choose to view individual units in the encyclopedia where they tell you what each unit evolves into on their own page with MASSIVE sprites you have to scroll down rather than in a table or something  or see the units in the class change menu  In the class change menu  you can promote or demote classes but you cant see things that arent in the immediate nest stage of the growth tree of the current class NOR CAN YOU EVEN SELECT THOSE CLASSES TO PREVIEW STATS AND ABILITIES FOR UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND PREREQUISITE STATS TO UPGRADE TO THAT CLASS  In order to see a map of relationships you need third party guides  note that this is especially important because you levelling actions matter from the very first moment  Even if you didnt want to optimise stats on you men  even finding out what can level into what is a chore   Movement and general squad building is super weird where type is based of majority characteristics  meaning optimised cavalry squads only need to have enough horses for 51 of the units to be mounted and the rest to move alongside them  Maybe this works if you take the squads to be abstractions of massive formations but as is it just feels immersion breaking   There is lots of stuff like what Ive already written  This game has insane praise on steam  Honestly if they had a mostly positive review I might not have batted an eye  But I expected greatness from this game  It is fine  playable  even fun  But it doesnt have the polish in quality of life I would expect from something overwhelmingly positive  I dont like how I have to jump to forums or dataminers just to figure out basics of the game like movement and movement cost   and I am NOT a stranger to complicated rules I assure you   Ive uninstalled because I feel like my current run and planned runs are now a bit of a waste of time  Because of how terrible the mechanics are to learn  even if they updated this  and I heard about it  I dont think I would even have the desire to pick it back up and learn

themselves to that end  For example  cavalry are unimpeded by hills or terrain such as woods  meaning that they can simply charge through what should be movement impediments and attack your ambush troops with ease  Thats inane   cavalry should be punished severely for fighting in unsuitable terrain  Heavy armor units should also be at a severe disadvantage when fighting in unsuitable terrain against light units  Also  if a unit is capable of performing ambush attacks  why cant it hide in the appropriate terrain Why is the damn thing still visible Some ambush   There is little to no information  save what is provided in text blocks during tutorials or the games encyclopedia  about the properties of all terrain tiles  Even the entries there are woefully incomplete and inadequate  What constitutes rough terrain Anything but grasslands Is a wheat field rough terrain What are the properties of swamps Do forests grant added protection against arrows they should Do hills do something besides provide 1 more range unit to ranged attacks they should  such as increased defense This means its first and foremost an RPG   NOT a tactical game   where stats are more significant than any sort of tactical capability   Speaking of the woefully inadequate game encyclopedia  it is missing explanations for a slew of status effects or further information for properly triggering charge and ambush attacks   sometimes they work  sometimes they dont  Theres no explanation as to why   according to the cavalry unit description if I move maximum range or 6 tiles before attacking an enemy I should get a charge attack  It also contains just blatantly incorrect information  For example  it states that siege cannon take up two tiles when they simply dont    Then there are the mission objectives and extra objectives  Mission objectives need to be met in order to finish a map  Some of them are simply stupid   for example  the swamp monastery map  The objective is to get your protagonists unit to a particular tile to end the mission  However  I had completely destroyed all enemy units  including reinforcements  I still had to waste several turns moving the protagonist unit to the specific tile in order to end the mission  The extra objectives grant you extra faction experience if completed  They include things such as ensuring that allied units survive  However  the allied AI and enemy AI  for that matter are utterly brain dead  For example  allied cavalry units consistently charged to their deaths against enemy units filled with pikemen and crossbowmen  One of the side objectives was to ensure no more than 2 of these cavalry units died  Of course I failed the objective due to their insanely suicidal and cavalier heh attitude toward life  Failing that objective was not on me   it was on the developers for coding cavalry units to blindly charge to their deaths against units specifically designed to destroy them  What sort of idiot commanders did the allies hire  Theres nothing inherently wrong with any of this  and the game is fun to play in order to level up different troop types and see how they function  My issue is   dont claim that tactics are relevant when you dont even take basic terrain factors into consideration  the AI is brain dead and suicidal  and you give the player super units who can unga bunga their way through an enemy force by simply being present   Edit  6132022 Note that todays patch may have addressed some of the issues above Other problems include certain tactics not working correctly  Zone of Control has no effect  as enemy units can still move full speed past my units   Magic is apparently less effective when used consecutively  so Im assuming that means if a healer uses a healing spell twice in a row it is less effective  Is that if used on a single unit  or just twice in general Is that per caster  or for your army overall over the course of a turn  The morale system is silly  You can kill a squads leader  utterly destroy the squad except for two archers or two casters who will get wrecked without any covering units  and they still might have a low to nil chance of surrendering  regardless of the size or composition of the unit attempting the surrender  Two unarmored casters out in the open getting attacked by a full squad of heavily armored knights Nope  no surrender  their morale is still fair  Cmon  thats just stupid   Edit 2 0   Chapter 12 is stupidly long and boring  and consists of you watching an overwhelming amount of enemy units move around  I guess the benefit is you can try to take as many out as possible to farm XP for your units  Honestly  they shouldve ended the chapter so I didnt have to waste an hour of my life watching the enemy army shuffle about  waiting for them to kill me   Escort mission  This map is pure RNG   if you can luckily one shot whole squads as they ram themselves to death against you  great Otherwise  quickload  No one likes escort missions  especially when the AI is brain dead and is only set to run to an objective  not avoid enemy units  Its like babysitting a lemming and trying to ensure it doesnt run off a cliff every five seconds     Enemy super units  You spend quite a few chapters avoiding  or running from  enemy super units that can one shot an entire squad  The devs fall back on this mechanic far too often  Boring and trite design   Valkyries  Theyre an utterly useless Tier 3  suffering from a massive identity crisis  They lack the healing power of a Tier 2 mounted healer despite the game specifically saying they have the healing capability of a hospitaller  lol and the attack power of a knight  making them pointless and a waste of a slot  Youll keep your mounted healers at Tier 2 if you want them to be effective  The class needs a mechanics re work to be useful   Flying units cant fly over walls in certain maps that they can fly over in other maps lol why Youre artificially limiting my tactical options  They also cant move or stop on certain tiles with no rhyme or reason   for example  where mountains meet plains  They also move more slowly than cavalry  Whats the point then  Stun is useless when ambushing   it applies to the missed attack due to the ambush  not the attack the enemy actually gets to take    What is this games obsession with water units Water unit recruits  water units in my starting squads  water units in recruited squads    water  water  everywhere  and not a drop to drink   Terrible map design   move a turn  bait minimal enemy units with heavy to soak  punish with light  ambush troops  repeat ad nauseam  Some maps are designed with enemy light ambush  stealth attack units already situated in rough terrain  There is nothing you can do to avoid this   you have to bait and soak the damage with heavy units  These maps typically have Donari temples past the rough terrain with enemy ambush units  as if the devs knew they set up the map to screw you   If you dont recruit as many units as possible early on youll get severely hosed later in the game  Late game recruits  including uniques  have horrid stat spreads that dont match their level  regardless of affinity  Youll see level 40 units with 30s and 40s in their primary class stats  making them worthless   I can see now with getting deeper into the game the devs spent too much time trying to craft a narrative instead of focusing on game design  The narrative they did craft is rife with spelling errors  at that  What a disappointment   if I want a good story Ill read a book or join in on a TTRPG  not play a video game  Im here for the tactical combat  not what your OC Donut Steel Amazonian mommy fetish paladin feels about Donar   I have no more room to express my

indie developer  I want people to play this game and support the developer  but I was disappointed by Symphony of Wars execution in almost every meaningful way   Im going to get the indie game criticisms out of the way  The art is extremely mismatched  the writing is rough and uneven  the UI is very clunky  the game doesnt handle resolution scaling well  the voice acting is awkward  deeper gameplay mechanics are largely unexplained  and that is just the start of my list of nagging annoyances  All of this bothered me  but none of it would have mattered if the rest of the game was stellar   Its not   Symphony of War is a marriage between Fire Emblem and Ogre Battle with unexplored hints of Advanced Wars  On paper  this premise seems incredible and it immediately sparked my imagination  But the more I played Symphony of War  the more I felt like the developers never took the opportunity to be icriticali of Fire Emblem and Ogre Battle  By the end of my time with SoW  I felt like it was a game that was blindly copying some of the worst elements of these two franchises rather than improving or innovating on them   The most egregious problem I have with Symphony of War is that the barebones basics of the squad based mechanic never worked for me and it only got more muddled as various unnecessary complexities were layered ontop of it  Ultimately  if youre not impressed by what Fire Emblem games do as tactical RPGs  SoW isnt going to change your mind  SoW plays on an even flatter 2D map than Fire Emblem  Its beholden to playerenemy phases rather than a turn clock for each individual squad  Maps are big and mostly empty with enemies that dont move unless you come within their range  so there are several empty turns where youre moving towards the objective or setting up against the next group of enemy squads  Most enemy units are fragile and die within one or two attacks but can also decimate one of your units if youre not careful  which further exacerbates all the problems with the rest of the Fire Emblem mechanics    Outside of the auto battler mechanic  SoW eschews everything that makes Ogre Battle unique or interesting  And I would argue that the Ogre Battler auto battler mechanic makes the Fire Emblem formula iworsei  For better or worse  Fire Emblem is a game where you are constantly playing on a knifes edge of minute calculations  How many enemy attacks can I survive Can I hedge my bets that Ill avoid the statistically average amount of attacks Am I willing to risk getting hit by an enemy crit But the squads and auto battles in SoW muddy these calculations significantly  You cant predict what is going to happen during a single attack  let alone predict a whole iphasei of defending against the enemy   I prefer tactical games to be played based on intuation rather than the calculation heavy approach Fire Emblem takes  But it feels like SoWs design emphasizes the calculation driven approach while also blindfolding you from making those necessary calculations    The balance is all over the place in SoW  too  Youre supposed to be making meaningful choices about the composition of your squads to try and counteract the enemy  but your choices are oftentimes hollow or outright meaningless  The auto battler just isnt great  Because all of your units attack at the same time  I constantly watched as pikemen who could one shot a unit of cavalry ganged up on a single guy  or saw a sorceress waste her one attack doing 12 damage to a priestess with high magic resist  or lamenting having group of rogues attack an enemy squads backline and split their attacks so evenly that they kill nothing  And honestly I dont think the developers could even fix this if they wanted to   it would make the auto battler feel even imorei swingy and in favor of the attackers if your squads had precise targets  By the end of the game  these issues are exacerbated by the fact that youre fielding big squads with 8 9 units each   Theres so much that is out of your control in SoW  Encounters oftentimes feel outright pointless because everything does so much damage or is so random that it doesnt matter what tactical nuances youre taking into account  To make the reliance on blind chance worse  all of the items and recruits available at shops every chapter are completely randomized and inconsistent  There are also weather effects that change your battle prowess and character affinities that affect growths and supports and a morale system and artifacts that you can equip to squads and a tech tree and resources and limited special powers on the tactical map and all sorts of other things Im probably forgetting  But none of this ever felt like it actually mattered  By the end of the game  the Ogre Battle mechanics transformed from neat and novel to unpredictable and irrelevant  There were even times where I stepped away for a refill during enemy phase because the stakes were ithati low   I wasnt thrilled about the scenario or map design  either  In just about every map  SoW sends a lot of expendible junk units at you to whittle at your insanity and HP pools  The entire game is played in a consistent cycle  Approach a group of enemy squads at the very edge of their reach  Let them get a couple of attacks against you on enemy phase  Decimate them on player phase  Heal up and proceed to the next group  And SoW bogs this down with things like bonus objectives that rely on keeping suicidal AI alive or out of the way resource nodes that are required to upgrade your units or largely underwhelming treasure chests   Finally  I wasnt happy with the difficulty  Normal was never challenging and felt like a testament to why Fire Emblem games need perma death to remain tactically interesting SoW demonstrates that you can constantly throw away your units and 100 clear the maps with scarcely any effort otherwise  Hard adds the aforementioned permadeath mechanic  but it feels hastily tacked on to please a niche audience and transforms SoW into a slow  plodding experience that revolves around praying the auto battler is kind to you and ensuring all of your units are revived before you complete the final objective of the map  This is a game that needs its mechanics rethought in order to introduce difficulty adding a 50 bonus to enemy damage isnt going to suddenly make it a strategic masterpiece  its just going to make the swinginess of the damage more problematic and progression even slower    Symphony of War is a game all about executing alpha strikes to decimate enemies so they can do minimal damage to you and then setting up for a safe enemy phase  People that are enthusiastic about a familiar gameplay loop like this are probably going to love Symphony of War  But for people like me that are tired of Fire Emblems grip over the market and frustrated by its homogeneous gameplay across idecadesi of titles  Symphony of War feels like an unwieldy experimental clone  SoW is a game with a severe identity crisis it doesnt know if it wants to be a tactical game where you have to fight tooth and nail to achieve victory with squads that take attrition losses over time or  if its a careful calculation simulator with permadeath that resembles Fire Emblem  In trying to be both and neither  it provides a disappointing experience that lacks strategic stakes and feels bloated by unnecessary content   There are moments where I thought Symphony of War really came into its own  The best parts of the game are when the objectives push you to move out your forces while discouraging turtling or when the attrition mechanics actually feel meaningful  I desperately wanted to love Symphony of War  but in the end  I cant even bring myself to recommend it with all its many flaws and inconsistencies ",2022-06-14,2022-06-14,False,50,7,0.579746127128601074,3,True,False,False

really dont like getting help for a game outside of the game itself b because it shows a fundamental incapability of the game to teach new players how to play and to ease them in to the experience   The game isnt all bad  even though you might think that from my first paragraph and my score   the game is 95 positive on Steam at the end of the day  so people obviously like it   Ill just do a short summary of some pros and some major cons that I found in my 100ish hours on steam and probably 20ish more on the free version from the games website   b Pros  b    b Massive amounts of content and variety b   the amount of classes and races that can be unlocked and played are astounding and really just outright impressive and the constant updates and expansions make this game just ridiculously packed with stuff     b Potentially huge replayability b the reason i say potentially will be explained in the cons section   this is basically because of the previous point and because of the way gear and builds are constructed much more similar to ARPGs like Diablo  PoE and Grim Dawn than to roguelikes     b Many  many stats are just laid out for the player to see and use b   for every enemy you encounter TOME will give you the exact description of everything that enemy can do and every single offensive and defensive stat it has     b Great community and developers b   Darkgod the main dev is a friendly fellow  the community will help you out when you need it and overall the atmosphere in the in game chat is always nice and helpful     b Streamlined roguelike mechanics b   what I mean by this is TOME either gets rid of some potentially annoying roguelike mechanics from ye old days for example an optional non permadeath mode for people just learning the game  removal of food mechanics that can be tedious    making it easier to pick it up as a newcomer to the genre     b Lore b   like  theres a lot of lore and not only that but its quite charming and fun to read and collect from letters  statues  books etc  Its mostly lighthearted with some dark moments plopped in here and there    b Cons b   now just to preface this  Im b not gonna mention the obvious indie game cons b the poor sound fx  average to dull looking graphics  somewhat clunky UI  theyre just part of the charm when playing these games and really are to be expected from small indie teams that focus more on gameplay and content     b Monster RNG b   this is by far the biggest and most annoying problem  Sometimes just no matter how lucky or unlucky you get with finding gear  no matter how carefully you plan your every move  every attack  every movement skill and infusion  you are sometimes gonna run into that one randomly generated rare monster that is b faster than you  stronger than you  is a caster and possesses multiple class abilities b   this can even happen in the early game first 30 minutes while your build hasnt even started to take shape  making this a huge pain in the ass   b this con is the one that broke my will to play the game  I cant stand just seeing a rare monster at the edge of my screen  and the next 3 turns being my health dropping by 25 per turn b  The rares need to be more manually fine tuned to not allow for some godlike super melee ranged caster movement speed god to spawn when i open a random door     b Some skills that you can spec into seem like noob traps  while others seem mandatory b   if youre playing a rogue and you dont pick up tumble I cant see you running away from any dangerous situation ever hell  even with tumble  disengage  rune of tp I sometimes couldnt outrun ghost rares that walk through walls  When talking about class variety class balance is of utmost importance   most of the skills need to be viable and none should be 100 mandatory in a perfect world  of course for finishing the game on normal setting  Everyone has different opinions on this one  so I understand if others dont think like me and think more in the lines of duh of course you should take mobility skills as a squishy melee class  its so obvious   b if its mandatory  then it should be auto given to everyone  not represented as a choice  b    b There isnt that much randomization world wise for a roguelike b   sure  items are totally random  as are rare enemies  but when you make a new character youre gonna be auto piloting the first 30 minutes because youll be running the same easy as hell early game dungeons until your build actually gets going  Theres nothing to keep you engaged during these first few zones   theyre too easy and theyre not randomized almost there are some with multiple possible bosses and layouts at all  apart from minor layout changes     b The combat is too easy and brainless 90 of the time b   the challenge in TOME doesnt come from normal white tier monsters   the challenge comes from random rares that can be super easy or super hard and from bosses well  mid and late game bosses at least  That means that when going trough zones especially the early game dungeons   like level 1 20 ones youre just gonna be on autopilot killing trash mobs while waiting for something challenging   this eases you into a false sense of security  and when that challenging fight comes your brain will be so invested in killing trash mobs that it wont even notice that youre dying until its too late  b The game just requires attention  but it isnt able to stimulate that attention in the player because its doing something entirely opposite   shutting the brain down with hundreds of easy trash mobs b     b The game is too trial and error based b   This is a consequence of the game not giving the player enough information so the player can know if they are strong or not combine this with the previous con and youve got yourself a feeling godlike but dying randomly in one hit out of nowhere situation   You wanna know if you character can clear Dreadfell Well    Uh    Go into Dreadfell and if you die the answer is no  and if you live the answer is yes    I guess  After 100 hours i can still barely tell if my shitty character can kill the master in 2 crits or if Im gonna kite him and his minions around the dungeon for 10 minutes and die to a plague at the end of that without killing the boss once     b The game is sometimes far to oldschool for it to feel comfortable b   look  Im a boomer in gaming  I like my OG Dooms  Quake 1  Shadow Warrior Classic  Old Total War games  Old Crash Bandicoot games  Diablo 2    But seriously sometimes the lack of directiontipstutorials  anything  is just weird  Like Im not even asking for fully fledged out tutorials  but at least  for example  give me a proper warning when opening dangerous rooms instead of a warning the game literally says do you want to open a door  or have some npc adventurer tell me there are some other dungeons in the world i should go check out to become stronger took me 50 hours to find out there are more than 2 beginner dungeons and more than 4 tier 2 dungeons on the map that never get mentioned by town npcs or teach me about debuffs and CC   all these systems are just pure trial and error  as in you have to teach yourself to use them cause the game sure as hell wont   Like I said I wont be putting UI  sound design  graphics etc  into the cons sections since this is a labor of love indie game  but Ill just quickly say that the UI isnt too terrible   its sometimes clunky and too secretive tho   This game has good dedication and love pored into it  but it just never clicked with me since I prefer other ways to challenge players  All in all TOME isnt for everyone   Try the free version on TOMEs site first ",2021-10-01,2021-11-12,False,47,0,0.765103280544281006,9,False,False,False

play as you start to seriously try to clear the game  On a basic level it is still a solid  unique experience worth trying out   Tales of Maj Eyal is really only a roguelike by inertia at this point  Stemming back to Angband mods  TOME has been in development in its current form for nearly 15 years and the author has been working on related projects for even longer  With TOME you are getting an ancient product that has been retooled and upgraded and expanded almost nonstop for most of the authors life and probably longer than most of you have even BEEN alive   Along the way  TOME has abstracted away almost all roguelike genre conventions  Traps are nonexistent  Hunger is gone  All items are identified  No potions  no scrolls  weight management is a formality at best    Everything is focused on Diablo loot and dozens of unique skill trees for the games over two dozen classes  There is almost nothing I have seen in the whole RPG genre that gives you the sort of variety TOMEs class trees offer  Everyone from the fighter to the wizard has two hotbars full of cooldown abilities and will usually be cycling 2 4 of them in any fight  Potion equivalents in this game are runes which are simply more equippable cooldown abilities that facilitate your get out of jail functionality  This game is honestly closer to turn based Diablo at this point than Rogue  with the piles of loot to match along with the single greatest QOL upgrade I have ever seen in the genre  a to sell box that holds all the loot you grab in a level  Before you leave  you can sort through it all  pull out anything that catches your eye  and anything left is auto sold  More games need to rip this feature off   The problem is this game is still bloated with 15 years worth of weight  For a game with so much class variety  runs last way too long  10 20 hours just to clear it once  The world map is bloated with dungeons and other crap that serves no purpose except for a few side quests that you must randomly find because they give skill points for garbage busywork  You will hit the level cap before you are even 66 through the game  Even worse  some of the content is tuned so tough some insane people insist on running extra dungeons on top just for earlier leveling or to fish for more loot   Worse still  turn based Diablo means you are constantly blasting hordes of trash enemies one at a time  slowly  one by one  ARPG hordes without ARPG speed and where bump combat is mostly discouraged in favor of alternating 1  2  1  3  1  2    hundreds of repetitive trash enemies in far too many pointless dungeon floors there to bore you until you find the one tough enemy  You can see his abilities  but your own are a dizzying mess of numbers spread all over the perk tree  good luck reading his and being able to guess Man that debuff sounds nasty  Can I resist it with my save stats Pro tip  enemy level means almost nothing Its a surprise and the prize is all your stuff goes on cooldown all at once and then he hits you for 3x your max hp on your second hit   Thats the other problem  You have all these interesting stat trees but the game doesnt end up giving you any useful info with them  Gear descriptions are horrific and basically require mods to present info in a useful fashion  Most of your skills are braindead picks the only defense skill but the ones that are not are tickets to reading online and see if in THIS version of the game is X dps route a noob trap or is Y And even then you cannot really make a guess as to if you can take this or that boss without having died to him already or hoping your escape options can actually get you out if you got knocked down to 2 hp in one hit  All this glosses over how long you have to play as a character to finally start amassing more complicated skill combos than just defense passive and two DPS actives you alternate between   The end result is a game that is full of contradictions  It aims high  almost to Etrian Odyssey tier in variety of class skills  a focus away from roguelike garbage and instead on tactical combat and ARPG build cobbling together  but it doesnt actually reward or engage with clever play  runs too long to let you actually enjoy the variety  does not make early game growth fun like even Battle Brothers  a game almost ENTIRELY about endlessly repeated early game growth  can  For the scope of what it offers  TOME is one of a kind and  again  a lot of these issues wont show up until you start playing to win over and over and over  but these are still significant problems for a game built around repeated play  I have tried to come back to this game over and over after my successful spite clear but I feel I have given it all the chances I can  I never even want to look at

ASCII roguelike game as well as several others  Tales of MajEyal or TOME is clone of ADOM  The keybinding are the same  classes are the same and fans of the original will find many more similarities  If I didnt enjoying play or rather enjoying dying in the original game  I probably would enjoy this game more    My general thoughts about the game trying to keep it balanced I enjoyed the different classes  Making decisions to improve my character  You always feel like you are improving  However your characters skills may improve  overall the game felt incredibly stale and boring  Who cares about the items the weapons the books This is what I turn my attention to next  looting system and gameplay   In TOME  I pick up a few weapons to kill a few more enemies more quickly as I mindlessly and easily kill them  I really didnt get any satisfaction from looting   This is because TOME is just sooo much easier than the original as well as TOME doesnt give you the chance to just pick up a weapon and try it  In ADOM  you can dig at the walls  getting some rocks if your axepick doesnt break where you can use to throw at the invading enemies  This is totally eliminated in TOME  You need a talent to even use a bow or sling Come on This meant for my playthrough I just had many millions of mindless  predictably leveled and simple enemies to grind my way through  Great for fans of WOW who love the grind and level up your character  but boring for everyone else  In ADOM  you are just one slime mold  hard armoured enemy  or river from losing your cherished weapon  In TOME  who cares Your weapon will never get damaged  In ADOM  if you pick up a special wand of teleportation with 2 charges  it could easy save your life in a tough pinch  Without that special item  you could easily die  If you carefully zap that wand when you have no other escape  it could save your life if your luck is with you  If luck is against you  you could still die and unlike TOME with almost infinite resaves roguelike my ass there is no teleporting back in the game once you died  If you used that wand too early  you might not have it later when you REALLY need it  Even a decision like using a wand was just sooo much more important in ADOM  In TOME  who cares You quickly get the tp spell on a 9 turn cooldown  In comparison  many games I didnt even run into the wand even once  So when you got the loot in ADOM  it really meant something  In TOME  looting was just a tedious chore    Let me explain more about the difference between TOME the clone and the original by way of a story  In ADOM  I remember being excited about finding every single item  Often high powered stuff would drop that was far above your level  If you got that loot  you were pretty much golden until it rusted  broke  was stolen by a thief  obliterated by spells  or burned up  Then when your prized weapon invariably was destroyed  you realized that you only had 7 rocks and two loaves of bread before starvation or death  Then after defeating a kobold  you realize that he dropped a book containing powerful magic  You hear something being killed in the level  so you open a door   lock it and begin to read the book  You feel more hunger and as the hunger continues to get stronger  you finish the book  and learn the magic  You then remember that you carefully dropped some food and some extra weapons on some stairs a few levels above  As you use your new powerful magic to destroy the enemies coming for you  you begin to feel more and more hungry first see yellow notification for hunger  then an orange notification  As Im describing this  I slipping a bit into the character of the game  The graphics were non existent  just letter characters for each enemy but the many choices you could make in the game made you feel like you were in the game  Getting back to the story  as our intrepid hero continues slowly towards the stairs  and the notifications continue to flash more dire  you realize that your hero is not going to make it  You look in your inventory  You notice a seed and a kobold corpse  You quickly eat the seed  You take one more step  staving off death for one more step  You are only a few steps from death  You look in the inventory and now you see a rotting kobold corpse  You realize that you are dead  You eat the kobold corpse  become paralyzed and stunned  After unsuccessfully trying to move  you suddenly die in two turns  still close to the stairs and the weapon and food drop  After heroically surviving the loss of your prized possession  your hero dies from starvation so close to his goal  This is what I loved about ADOM  getting really high level loot  getting attacked by surprising high level enemies  almost dying  surviving before finally dying    I have lost many many characters in ADOM  It was really interesting trying to discover the code for the game  I tried my best  but like Sid Meiers Pirates  the game was next to impossible to finish  TOME has many elements that I loved about the original  Discovering the Infinite Dungeon  Trolls Cave  Gladiator Tournament all felt cool to me once again  I still really enjoy the premise behind TOME  I think Ill probably eventually end up playing more of this game  Maybe if I can create some overpowered raccoonscompanions to follow me around  Ill feel like less of a letdown  I had a lot of happy memories playing ADOM  Throwing massive stones throw doorways to break the doors down into very much needed wood that I could use to make arrows was a lot of fun  Even creating loyal zombies to follow me around as a necromancer was a lot of fun  Fighting powerful enemies that could stun you  blind you  or do many dastardly things to you was a lot of fun  If I can dramatically ramp up the difficulty  TOME might do it for me    I only dont recommend it because as a die hard fan  I feel they could have done so much more    ",2016-05-03,2016-05-03,False,9,5,0.415303438901901245,9,True,False,False

years ago i even wrote some content for Muds  That doesnt make me the ultimate authority  but it shows that i play and enjoy many different low graphic RPGRogue likes   Ultimately I regret purchasing this and  if I could  would refund this game   The game reminds me of Dragon Crystal a game i love and seems at first glance a re implementation  Unfortunately the balancing reminds me more of Mid Boss  which wouldnt be a problem however the game disables most kinds of grinding due to the foodHP binds  To bring to a point  The game is balanced around running around starving and only eating food between 25 50 health      The graphics are fine and the enemies are varied and mostly interesting  The bosses are well designed and enjoyable   However there are many structural problems that make this extremely un enjoyable for me     It has RPG elements with stats but throws out all of them  except STR  which is purely used as gating  it even enforces this by only showing STR and not the auto stats you get during level up It implements classes and sub classes with skills and perks  yet there is not a single interesting or exciting skill in the game  In all my runs i have looked at the first two level ups and then only very occasionally went back into the skill window to click random buttons  There are no skills that add utilityescapecontrol   It has resource management that is completely thrown out the window because there is only two resources that are relevant to a run   It has tons of weapons  armor  equipment  scrolls and potions  Despite that  only three things are relevant  STR potions gated balancing  upgrade scrolls gated balancing and food  Some items are fun and rings if you can identify them are definitely useful  but they dont make or break the game  There arent items except STR and UPGR that you pick up and use immediately  Especially weapons and armor are ideally only ever replaced once  the game is sort of balanced around this If you dont get a high level weapon andor armor drop in the first 3 levels  restart  On the other hand i have frequently gotten top tier items on level three  which i have only been able to use once during a run   It has interesting map generation with secret rooms and traps  but exploring is punished  especially in the later parts of the game due to the balancing and food and HP binds  Trap searching or secret searching for that matter is punished to the point that stepping on most traps during a let me get to the down stairs is less impactful than searching for traps  I guess the developer realized that the binds are too rough to be searching a lot and also  who wants to hit search every step especially on phone and made most traps very low impact   Some items are used in puzzles  which are interesting the first time you get there  but after the third area  the puzzle rooms become a liability  And usually the puzzles lead to a chest with loot that is as far ive seen rarely STRUPGR  The one thing puzzles are useful for is identifying potions and scrolls  That room over there requires a haste potion and you found only a pink potion on that floor Guess what that is  I like this aspect of the game a lot  It incentivises paying attention to drops and some basic combining of clues   It has crafting  but crafting is gated hu and very low impact  except a number of OP i win items that are relatively hard to get every run until very late  Also inventory is very limited until you buy at least two upgrades and then it becomes kinda pointless  It has gardening  but does very little with it  as enemies dont step into traps  Its like most of the potions and scrolls  Throwing a potion of liquid flame sets the room aflame  has a chance to burn your scrolls and do less dmg to enemies than to you  Freezing potions can shatter your potions and do less to enemies than to you even when thrown  Mirror image scrolls are neat  until the images die in one hit and the mobs completely ignore them and go for you anyway  Teleport is a good escape  but i found on average maybe two during a run    Balancing     The game isnt hard  not in any way  it is just very volatile with strict ranges of gating and binds  Lets put it this way  if the gating mechanisms werent in the game it would be easy and boring  It seems to me that the developer realized that early on and started to add gating see Mid Boss mechanism and binds to minimize farming and trivializing content because of full healing  Balancing in a rogue like is difficult  Heck it is difficult in custom designs  It is difficult in turn based games  That is because less actions make every action more important to the extent that every turn based game eventually devolves into a puzzle game  Running empty rooms is 100 boring  until you step on a summoning trap  which has been the death of me in many a run in any game The game is balanced around cheesing high dodge enemies both for HP and food binds  which is generally fine as there are enough terrain features around  Unfortunately  as good as the map generation is  so bad is the spawning and de spawning of enemies  Stepping on a summon trap in the middle of the open is usually a death sentence  regardless of where you are in a run  multi hits also seem to be buggy in the PC release  do not fight against more than one enemy at a time Did i mention there is little utility or control that we get Have a look at Nethack  which is basically just a first solve this  then solve that  afterwards solve     simulator  Imagine Dredmore without any kind of utility or control skills     It very unsuccessfully mixes evasion based and resist based tanking  both for the player and for the mobs  The results are exactly as one would expect  you run three floors without a scratch only to be nearly one shot by a normal mob  This together with the only eat when you are 25 health premise and the outcome is very volatile  Not hard  just random  if you think the rogues hide skill is control  no  it is part of the general gating as calculated part of his dmg and avoidance  plus it blocks an equip slot  A number of principles that are generally implemented in these cases  only deteriorate hunger when actually healing  This is employed in many turn based rogue likes  It keeps the binds and forces to go deeper  but doesnt punish puzzle solving or exploration  Dont punish equips  not everything has to be gated and maybe make it a decide the best outfit to fight enemy xyz  Have a look at dragon crystal  this is solved very elegantly there  Dont double punish exploration  make searching just waste time  Dont spawn enemies if you dont want farming in your game  This would also make the later levels definitely more interesting for me  The

this extremely un enjoyable for me     It has RPG elements with stats but throws out all of them  except STR  which is purely used as gating  it even enforces this by only showing STR and not the auto stats you get during level up It implements classes and sub classes with skills and perks  yet there is not a single interesting or exciting skill in the game  In all my runs i have looked at the first two level ups and then only very occasionally went back into the skill window to click random buttons  There are no skills that add utilityescapecontrol   It has resource management that is completely thrown out the window because there is only two resources that are relevant to a run   It has tons of weapons  armor  equipment  scrolls and potions  Despite that  only three things are relevant  STR potions gated balancing  upgrade scrolls gated balancing and food  Some items are fun and rings if you can identify them are definitely useful  but they dont make or break the game  There arent items except STR and UPGR that you pick up and use immediately  Especially weapons and armor are ideally only ever replaced once  the game is sort of balanced around this If you dont get a high level weapon andor armor drop in the first 3 levels  restart  On the other hand i have frequently gotten top tier items on level three  which i have only been able to use once during a run   It has interesting map generation with secret rooms and traps  but exploring is punished  especially in the later parts of the game due to the balancing and food and HP binds  Trap searching or secret searching for that matter is punished to the point that stepping on most traps during a let me get to the down stairs is less impactful than searching for traps  I guess the developer realized that the binds are too rough to be searching a lot and also  who wants to hit search every step especially on phone and made most traps very low impact   Some items are used in puzzles  which are interesting the first time you get there  but after the third area  the puzzle rooms become a liability  And usually the puzzles lead to a chest with loot that is as far ive seen rarely STRUPGR  The one thing puzzles are useful for is identifying potions and scrolls  That room over there requires a haste potion and you found only a pink potion on that floor Guess what that is  I like this aspect of the game a lot  It incentivises paying attention to drops and some basic combining of clues   It has crafting  but crafting is gated hu and very low impact  except a number of OP i win items that are relatively hard to get every run until very late  Also inventory is very limited until you buy at least two upgrades and then it becomes kinda pointless  It has gardening  but does very little with it  as enemies dont step into traps  Its like most of the potions and scrolls  Throwing a potion of liquid flame sets the room aflame  has a chance to burn your scrolls and do less dmg to enemies than to you  Freezing potions can shatter your potions and do less to enemies than to you even when thrown  Mirror image scrolls are neat  until the images die in one hit and the mobs completely ignore them and go for you anyway  Teleport is a good escape  but i found on average maybe two during a run    Balancing     The game isnt hard  not in any way  it is just very volatile with strict ranges of gating and binds  Lets put it this way  if the gating mechanisms werent in the game it would be easy and boring  It seems to me that the developer realized that early on and started to add gating see Mid Boss mechanism and binds to minimize farming and trivializing content because of full healing  Balancing in a rogue like is difficult  Heck it is difficult in custom designs  It is difficult in turn based games  That is because less actions make every action more important to the extent that every turn based game eventually devolves into a puzzle game  Running empty rooms is 100 boring  until you step on a summoning trap  which has been the death of me in many a run in any game The game is balanced around cheesing high dodge enemies both for HP and food binds  which is generally fine as there are enough terrain features around  Unfortunately  as good as the map generation is  so bad is the spawning and de spawning of enemies  Stepping on a summon trap in the middle of the open is usually a death sentence  regardless of where you are in a run  multi hits also seem to be buggy in the PC release  do not fight against more than one enemy at a time Did i mention there is little utility or control that we get Have a look at Nethack  which is basically just a first solve this  then solve that  afterwards solve     simulator  Imagine Dredmore without any kind of utility or control skills     It very unsuccessfully mixes evasion based and resist based tanking  both for the player and for the mobs  The results are exactly as one would expect  you run three floors without a scratch only to be nearly one shot by a normal mob  This together with the only eat when you are 25 health premise and the outcome is very volatile  Not hard  just random  if you think the rogues hide skill is control  no  it is part of the general gating as calculated part of his dmg and avoidance  plus it blocks an equip slot  A number of principles that are generally implemented in these cases  only deteriorate hunger when actually healing  This is employed in many turn based rogue likes  It keeps the binds and forces to go deeper  but doesnt punish puzzle solving or exploration  Dont punish equips  not everything has to be gated and maybe make it a decide the best outfit to fight enemy xyz  Have a look at dragon crystal  this is solved very elegantly there  Dont double punish exploration  make searching just waste time  Dont spawn enemies if you dont want farming in your game  This would also make the later levels definitely more interesting for me  The puzzles are interesting and kind of show how to maybe use certain items  But in the general run of the mill level i cant justify using any potions because there arent enough  Also potions sort of trivialize some of the boss fights i e  invis for DM300 ",2023-01-21,2023-01-21,False,40,5,0.574104130268096924,6,True,False,False
