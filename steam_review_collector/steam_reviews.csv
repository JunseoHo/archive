time of writing this and plan on putting much more into it  The problem I have with Palworld doesnt stem from how fun it is  rather the lack of personality and the copycat nature of the game   h3 Copying Games h3 The game is a chimera of preexisting ones  Pokemon  Zelda  BotW  and ARK being the main focus  I understand imitating or gaining inspiration from other games  but Palworld is a blatant copy and doesnt try to hide it  Looking at Pocketpairs other releases  it looks like they only create games to play off of the hype of others popularity besides that one card game they made  but reviews are mixed anyways and I dont know anything about it  Apparently AI was used in the games creation as well  just to add on to the controversy  It just makes for a game that I feel like I have played before and doesnt have enough individuality to not compare it to others  This is exactly what the game is aiming for  though  so I suppose Pocketpair did well in that regard  h3 Copying Pokemon h3 I have been a fan of Pokemon for well over 15 years now  I started playing when Soul Silver released back in 2010 and collected cards a while before that  A good amount of the Pals designs are EXTREMELY close to Pokemon  enough to the point where my friends that dont play Pokemon notice and point it out to me  I know that there are like over 1000 Pokemon at this point  so similarities are going to pop up  These are not just similarities  they are straight up copies  You can copy my work but change it up a bit so the teacher doesnt notice type shit  You can say that its hard to make something that doesnt look like a Pokemon  but look at Yu Gi Oh  Digimon  Yo kai Watch  Shin Megami Tensei  and Fossil Fighters  just to name a few that I have played  They have very i similar i aspects and designs  but have their own personality and flair to the series that sets them all apart and makes them shine in the Creature Collector genre  My point is that you can make great designs without just copying something  Its a shame because I think that some of the Pals do stand out and have really fun designs  so it makes me disappointed to see what we could have got if more care was put into the game  Tombat is my favorite  with others like Mossanda  Sweepa  and Bushi being others I can think of that stand out as fun and pretty original designs that are hard to compare to already existing franchises  If the entire roster had this personality  I think the game would feel less like a minimal effort copy and more like a passion project  As it stands  though  most of the Pals are just copies and that makes its personality suffer for that   h3 Nintendo Kiss Ass h3 Im not hiding the fact that I love the world that Game Freak and Nintendo have created  Im also not going to hide the fact that they put out the same game over and over again with varying degrees of quality  Scarlet and Violet being the worst and most recent culprit of this fact  Nintendo is too scared to do something new with their games and its getting stale  There are also no PC ports of games  which forces you buy their shitty consoles  Obviously Nintendo fans are pretty sick of it  so hearing about Pokemon with guns sounds like a great idea  Yeah  stick it to the man and show them you can make a game better than them is what I wish I could say  but as I stated before  Palworld is just a rehash of a bunch of different games  How can it be better than any of the other games if its just the same shit I want to play something that i surpasses i the thing it is trying to imitate  Aim to be better  aim to be more fun  aim to be something more  This game doesnt do that   h3 Buggy Asset Flip h3 Im pretty positive this game uses most of its assets from their earlier title  Craftopia  Everything just looks like a Unity asset anyways  The world doesnt fit the Pals designs at all  As funny as it is to watch the little grass monkey whip out the 9  it really takes me out of it  The guns and equipment are all so realistic looking  the weird anime characters look strange and out of place  all the armor and equipment is just recolors of the other shit  I just dont get some of it at all  All the NPCs talk about the Pals mauling and eating everyone  but the Pals dont actually do that and most of the time just shoot some elemental blast at you and then walk away like nothing happened  Ive seen so many Pals divebomb into the ground and disappear forever  Things clip  run into walls  and get stuck in terrain  The animations of everything besides the Pals are lackluster  all the terrain is copy pasted  and world has no substance to it  Also the building is bad   h3 The Building Is Not Fun h3 The building is b ASS  b I dont really know why  but I hate it  It might not even be that bad  I dont know  I hate it   h2 Conclusion h2 The game is fun  dont get me wrong  I enjoy playing it and look forward to what comes next  I rambled on too long and this is probably full of mistakes and hypocrisies  but I want to love this game  It has everything it needs to be  but the creator just doesnt care  It was obviously made to make a few quick bucks off of the popularity of other games  Theres no personality  no soul  no care  no love  I want more from Palworld  I want better  I hope in the future updates that new  interesting Pals and locations are added  For now  though  I cant recommend the game to anyone because I dont want to support Pocketpair  I want to support b Palworld  b",2024-02-15,2024-02-15,False,46,1,0.58149641752243042,6,True,True,True

the end of the day  b  I dont think I would have spent almost 500 hours playing this game if it wasnt   I really want to start with what I like about the game before we get into the negative   Im nearing 3 decades on this world and let me tell you that b we have been waiting for a Pokemon Minecraft style of game since the start  b  This is 100 exactly what Pokemon should have made Legends Arceus as  But instead  they didnt    The basic game loop is your typical crafting survival game  but they toss in Pals as an addition to this genre  Much like in Pokemon  you can catch  tame  battle and fight with and against other Pals  They even have human NPCs such as Merchants  Bandits  and more that act in the background as hints towards a deeper lore for the game on top of being new slave additions to your bases   You can gain levels by accruing experience points through a multitude of tasks  which allot you points to spend on a technology tree  Much of the game revolves around this grind   the loop of getting stronger  making stronger and better things to take on harder stuff  etc   The map is huge  Some people may enjoy the appeal of an ever changing world through procedural generating  but the static map of Palpagos Islands is amazing as is  There are plenty of biomes to explore fostering all types of different Pals to catch and experiement with    The base building capabilities are so exciting   very Valheim esque  With the hopes for less strict parameters on building the potential can be limitless   Beyond that simple loop   you get the enticing end game that is Pokemon  Trying to get the perfect IVs on your Pals  breeding galore  and soon to be PVP  This is all with single player in mind   you can play this with friends Up to 4 co op  or b as many as you want through dedicated servers b  The ability to experience this entire game not only in itself  but with friends also make it just about a home run for every Pokemon and Minecraft fan looking to bridge that genre gap    With that being said  there are some i glaring i issues that Palworld and Pocket Pair seem to be experiencing that overall has just turned off any prolonged interest I have for this game in particular or anything Pocket Pair releases from here on out   Oh boy  Where to begin   Perhaps the allegations To start  there are some i very clear inspirations from Pokemon i that can be seen reflected in a lot of the Pals  I dont need to name them  there are plenty of videos doing that already  but it is very evident  I want to try and justify that its hard to have a trademark on some of these creatures since Pokemon has literally made a monster out of almost everything at this point like they have ice cream cones as a pokemon  But even with that critique  some of the Pals look almost like reskins of some existing Pokemon   It also seems to just be a mesh of three games  Zelda  BOTW  Pokemon and Minecraft  Again  as mentioned before  it can be stated that its just heavily inspired by the three   but as someone who has poured b hundreds of hours b into Zelda  BOTW  it feels so eerily similar in gameplay   Now the next statement is completely my non verified opinion  but it really feels like the Palworld devs went to AI and said Can you make me a game that utilizes the mechanics from Zelda  BOTW  with the gameplay style of MinecraftValheim mixed with Pokemon and AI chugged out the code for Palworld   More baseless claims  but its fascinating that this game can do so well and be so successful in that amount of time only for it to now quickly degrade into what it will inevitably become  Trash  A great game ran by a trash company    If you feel the ideas of the game were just taken from other games   thats one thing  But so much of Palworld really does feel like copypastes with some tweaking so that the work didnt look i too i alike    They clearly sold b a lot b of copies  But since their massive  explosive growth at the beginning of 2024  the updates have been far and few   with directions being taken that no one seems to be asking for    The game is b riddled b with hackerscheaters on any online server  This has been an issue since the start and continues to persist to this day  They have yet to implement a proper anti cheat to address this  The avenues to combat this are completely left up to the individual  Insane   There are very clear stability issues  RAM build up and leakage  Redundancy in code  Save file data corruptions  Lag and instability in populated servers  It really feels like a single player port onto a multiplayer map  and the code is so janky   You would think after making millions around the start of 2024  they would hire on more staff to address these issues  But instead  they shifted staff over from their other games to compensate  and they continue to be vastly unprepared   Their official Discord is like walking into the Badlands  Its a toxic wasteland that is completely inhospitable to newcomers and even veterans alike  Staff are extremely unprofessional in dealing with any actual complaints  and instead seem to be stuck in a vicious cycle of ignoring their community and posting small  inadequate updates about more content being added rather than addressing any of the existing issues within their game   The communication from Pocket Pair   even when we do get it  is extremely lacking and insufficient  Most of their community level responses equate to sorry you feel that way  please leave and come back later   I understand this game is in Early Access  I understand they explicitly did so because they were running out of funds for this game  But they clearly have those funds now   I dont think them not having funds was the issue  Its very clear that Pocket Pair is mismanaged at too many levels in order to make Palworld what it could actually be    In short  Great concept of a game that had amazing growth and potential solely based off of the concept and this haphazard execution  but will ultimately die and decay as either Papa Nintendo plops out their version or i literally any other indie dev i does it better  Pocket Pair aint it   Update 42124   Still Just as bad as before  Dont think any of these updates have changed anything for the better  Yikes Pocket Pair

genuinely surprised this game is getting Very Positive Reviews right now  Because holy shit there are some serious issues in the game that need to be addressed  And I have gone through the reviews and a lot of them are either kissing ass to the devs  heavily bullshitted  or just simply not real reviews      To keep it simple  Imma make a list of the major ithingsi meaning the good and the bad about the game that I have seen  and that give me the reason to make this review  And to lay out why I believe that despite the Very Positive reviews  why this game went from a huge 160k peak  to only 17k and slowly declining as the time goes by     h3Graphicsh3  Realistically Graphics arent really that bad  I will say that the game is visually really nice  with exception to the obvious visual glitches and bugs that most to all who play the game already know about  Especially if you are an AMD user like me     h3Building Systemh3  Personally this is where I strongly believe the game really shines  Think Minecraft    With a little bit of Conan ExilesArk  and a lot of Valheim  I love the detail that they put into the building system  and personally this has become my main and sadly only at this point favorite aspect of the game  The fact that you can essentially build bLITERALLYb anywhere on the map Whether its on a mountain side  in a valley  on a hill  IN the hill  or just completely underground is amazing to me  And hope that other games from here on out take from this    Because God it is a beautiful system  And the different sized blocks  from big to small  that allow you to add more detail to your building is the icing on the cake    h3The Combath3 Here is where I think the game slowly falls off    The combat has to be the most underwhelming aspect of the game    From literally the second you spawn in on a new character    To whatever level I am level 11 now at the time of making this    It literally feels like you never progress  because everything out there is always higher level than you and stronger than you the more you explore  The fact that I am leveling up  getting stats  getting food  buffs  armor  you name it    And I am STILL getting just absolutely destroyed by anything I encounter is ridiculous  Wildlife not a huge issue  But I am sick of exploring in the shroud or in a camp or whatever  and just immediately getting overwhelmed by mobs and just having to sweat and struggle to survive  ESPECIALLY when they are the same if not a couple levels above me Like what kinda system is that I get it if I wander into a camp with enemies like 4 or 5 levels above me    But 1 or 2 higher Come on    They shouldnt be just 2 3 shotting me like my metal armor is made of paper  and my stats dont mean shit  ON TOP OF why does it feel like my attacks literally do nothing to them Yet the smallest attack just obliterates me Doing my jump attack and I get slapped outta the air  or getting knocked down in the middle of attacks  meanwhile the player cant stagger enemies themselves What kinda combat is that Every time I go to fight something  I feel like I am playing Dark Souls and I need to do a bumb before I engage  Like holy fuck  tone it down and give the player something to work with Especially when they ARE JUST STARTING THE GAME We shouldnt be sweating the fights at level ONE   h3The FUCKING Staminah3 Here is where I feel I am gonna lose some people  but honestly I dont give a fuck because we are allowed to have our own opinions  And I feel there might be a few who will agree to this    Why am I bCONSTANTLYb battling stamina The amount of times I have died because I am just constantly out of stamina is insane to me  I feel like I am a morbidly obese 65 year old man with lung cancer chasing an ice cream truck I run out of stamina so fucking fast its not even funny  I will have 2 and a half circles  and I still run out in seconds during combat  Because its like EVERYTHING uses a FUCK TON of stamina  Dodging  blocking  jumping  running out of the way which you have to do because everything is if not equal  FASTER than you  Either get rid of stamina all together  or buff the fucking hell out of it  Because early on in the game it is nothing but a cancer  That or make it to where only certain things cost stamina and other things dont because holy fuck  That or make it to where you can get away from enemies without the need to sprint and use it up  because right now    This is a game killer for me    h3QuestingExplorationh3 So this one is kind of a 5050 for me  where the storyquest line whatever it is  I dont really pay attention to it isnt bad per se  it is executed poorly  And what I mean by that is  the quests themselves arent bad or hard    Its just    Why am I getting a quest for an area I am not supposed to be in yet Like getting the quest for the new Hollow Halls that for some fucking reason you decided to put in the bSTARTING AREAb of the game and all the mobs are in abundance and higher level As well as the exploration quests being in areas you cant access because of either too high level enemies  or its blocked by deadly shroud    Which makes the quest almost impossible to complete    Also  please    PLEASE for the love of god  add something that helps players find resources Something in the journal  more map markers that we can use to mark it when we find it  SOMETHING There are so many things in this game  and I shouldnt have to TAB OUT OF THE GAME to look it up    h3Certain Mechanical BugsIssuesh3 Now here is where I have had some of my biggest issues    Where either there is input delay in my controls ie  When I attack it feels like I have to wait like 5 seconds before I can jump  or else it literally doesnt happen  I spam the space bar  no jump     or when I shoot my bow and the arrow is like selective on what it hits And doesnt hit what I shot Like what the fuck is that  Why am I aiming at an explosive barrel and the arrow is hitting the thing that is 5 feet to the leftright of it I seriously cant make this up    The arrows literally prioritize OTHER things other than what you are aiming at  That needs to be fixed  And then the amount of times where I have seen mobs just slide themselves up cliffs to attack me cliffs a player most definitely could not climb himself  As well as the times where I try to go in one direction  and my character just completely either doesnt turn or just does some weird shit like when I am gliding  omg its the worst  There are a lot    And my god it is so bad and aggravating when it happens in what I like to call dire times Like in combat  or other character life threatening situations where you need to act fast    h2TDLR  For those who could care less to read my criticismsh2 At the end of the day I cant say it is a terrible game    It definitely has some good aspects to it  and if the devs actually work on it and notice the issues    It could potentially be a great game  But right now in its current state  unless you are willing to put the cold sweat and tears into actually making something in this game   OR if you actually have the people to play this game  I will admit with some friends you could have a great experience  But as a solo player talking to other solo players    This is not it right now  I am sorry but I cant recommend this title  Sure for 30 USD its worth the few hours to check out if you really want to    But to call it a great game Nah  not me bro  sorry  I am genuinely shell shocked that more people arent complaining about this   That or I wouldnt be

need to be addressed badly  With a bit of luck  the developer will see this and hopefully some of these will be addressed   First  Building a base feels entirely pointless  Other than to look aesthetically pleasing and to put your loot in  they borderline serve no purpose right now  They cant be raided  they dont need to be defended and because you can only have 1 copy of the NPCs spawned in the world  you basically only have one base with the other bases acting as nothing more than fast travel points at best  These separate Bases you use as fast travel points can absolutely cripple the balance of the game as they allow you to do some pretty extreme exploits that instantly obliterate all difficulty and the worst part is  you can do this accidentally   Second  The NPCs feel completely pointless other than acting as an extra work bench you have to run to  Sure  they give you quests but for the most part  they act as another step in crafting that feels unnecessary  For example  in other games  you would make a basic crafting bench  then move up to an advanced crafting bench and then the best crafting bench  Each bench higher than the last allows you to craft all of the previous benches stuff and more  In Enshrouded  thats not the case  Instead  you have to craft a work bench  then the NPC  then the NPCs separate work benches to unlock crafting with the NPC AND their work benches separately  Its needlessly more steps   Third  Recipes can be incredibly inconsistent to unlock or even to make certain items  For example  You can unlock the Iron Pickaxe recipe by finding iron ore but the Iron Felling Axe isnt unlocked until you have metal bars  then when you do have metal bars  the Iron Pickaxe can be made without any special workbench but the Axe needs Smithing Tools which are way later in the quest line  The issue with this is because you gain XP through mining but not felling trees  you now have one of the fastest ways to gain XP in the game by just rushing to the end zone which is incredibly easy to do  mining some Iron and you can now get to the max level within hours mining copper in the beginner zones   Fourth  The entire point of the Red Fog confuses me  So its clear that the map is separated by lines of Red Fog to stop you from going to zones you shouldnt be in until you upgrade your flame    But the devs put shortcuts to get through the red fog such as bridges so you can easily bypass the red fog  This results in players being able to run to the right of the map where all the best loot spawns in chests and get end game gear at the start of the game rendering crafting largely pointless   Fifth  Because everything outside of your bases build zone completely respawns when you quit to menu and then boot your game back up  it means you can exploit the living hell out of the game and often without even meaning to  For example  there are a lot of unguarded chests in the end zone that drop max level items including amazing armour and the best weapons in the game  If you make a base near to those chests  you can just get the chests  go back to menu  open the game back up  go back to those chests and open them for another roll at whats in the chests all while keeping what you picked up last time  Within an hour of doing chest runs as a level 13  I managed to get the best weapons and almost the best armour in the game using this method and I only found out about it by accident  Because the game doesnt have a pause  whenever I would go to the toilet or need to take care of something  I would go back to the menu and in turn I quickly realised everything respawns  including chests  This can also be infuriating if you had to dig out parts of mountains to reach locations as you now need to re dig that out  This is also an issue if you just cleared out an area so you can mine or gather only to have to fight everything again   Finally  After getting some of the best armoursweapons and building up a massive base  I came to the realisation that there is absolutely nothing left to do  If you are unlucky enough to find a top tier legendary weapon early  there is literally nothing to strive for  It could be because I havent done many of the quests As they were rendered completely pointless by the loot system but from what I can see  there is absolutely nothing to do now  I know that the game is early access and while the game is much better than say Valheim  at least Valheim had base raids so you have to spend time making good bases and the difficulty of fights was still incredibly hard even against things you out geared   I hope these issues can be addressed as there is so much potential here  but right now there are also some pretty crippling flaws  I dont doubt that the devs care about the game  especially when compared to something like Valheim where the Devs have basically abandoned the game so I will be happy to come back to the game when its had much more time to cook but as it stands now  I would say hold off and wait for updates if any of what I said in this review is an issue for you ",2024-04-18,2024-04-18,False,8,0,0.562513768672943115,0,True,False,True

crafting games  Enshrouded relies on a stamina system complete with dodge rolling however the stamina system is really only there to be a pain in the ass due to poor balance and implementation  Id like to be charitable and say that my problems with Enshrouded are mostly due to its Early Access state  but I cant  Theres no way the devs made this combat system or design encounters like this on accident   Jumping doesnt require stamina  but halts stamina regeneration for a few seconds  Climbing a metal grate drains stamina quickly  but climbing a ladder doesnt  Attacking doesnt cost stamina or interfere with stamina regen  but dodge rolling does  Dodge rolling doesnt provide any i frames and you often times will just get hit anyway due to poor enemy hitboxes   Ive actually performed sideways rolls that caused my character to loop all the way around the enemy and into their attack anyway  I wish I could say that I just made that up  but I cant   Many enemies are damage sponges that are capable of dealing lethal amounts of damage to the player in an instant leading to combat feeling like a chore  And you will be doing a lot of fighting  Those generic Scavengers youve been fighting Why not make one green and give it even more health  double the speed  and double the damage Those shroud beetles youve been fighting Why not make red ones that will explode when hit dealing hundreds of damage each  My level 25 character  with quite a bit invested into Constitution and good armor takes 297 damage from one of these things  Playing as a melee character Well enjoy the Kindlewastes where youre going to fight flying birds that are a pain in the ass to hit as a melee character because for some reason every weapon does horizontal attacks  Sure  you can stun them by parrying them repeatedly  but the parry mechanic  like nearly every other aspect of Enshroudeds combat is jank and unreliable  Those same generic enemies youve been fighting since the beginning will take 3x longer to kill in the current end game  even with level 25 EpicLegendary weapons and you will be fighting more of them at once   The lock ontargeting system in this game is a joke for all playstyles  but its the worst for magic  Even when locked on to an enemy  wands just have a mind of their own and will target enemies youre not even locked onto  The lock on mechanic loves prioritizing the enemy furthest  even when youre being swarmed by 10 enemies at a time  and you will be regularly facing very large groups of enemies  If you get hit by an enemy and are staggered this will cause the lock on target to change in most cases   Bosses are a joke  They deal high damage  but also move and attack much slower than many of the games most basic enemies  making what should be the appropriately challenging encounters  the easiest of all  I dont think combat will improve much as updates are rolled out   Together  the aforementioned aspects of Enshroudeds combat lead me to not respecting the games content  By the time I had progressed to the Nomad Highlands I stopped fighting enemies altogether unless I absolutely had no choice  or specifically needed an item that only enemies drop  An Elixir Well Just use the glider and skip right to the Shroud Root you can do this with most Elixir Wells  City full of Scavengers Just run past them and proceed to the quest objective or boss fight   Other aspects of Enshrouded are a chore as well  Want to build a house out of wood Well first you need to turn those Wooden Logs into blocks at a crafting bench and then use those blocks to build  An unnecessary currency exchange that made me stop building stuff after a while  Crafting stations  decorations  etc are all inventory items that can only be placed by equipping them to an action bar  which leads to a lot of menu hopping as you build and furnish  Theres no option to breakdown these items either  Its either delete it  place it  or put it in a chest  Contrast this with Fallout 4s building system where you have the option to not only scrap building pieces  decorations etc  but also the option to store these things and they are stored within the building menu itself   Equipment itemization is yet another chore  Crafting gear is mostly useless since it takes more timeeffort than farming chests  Since the game resets every time you enter your world  its much faster and much more effective to gear via chests than crafting  Chest rewards  poor rng aside  will yield superior equipment compared to what you can craft  Also  why cant I salvage a weapon  but not armorrings   I could go into more shit wrong with this game like the Hollowed Halls  but I should stop here  Enshrouded is truly a game of all time  but not one that Id recommend unless the developers do some major overhauls to various aspects of the game  Necesse  Valheim  Palworld are all better Early Access choices ",2024-04-14,2024-04-14,False,3,0,0.518518507480621338,0,True,False,True

out  Here are some of my thoughts divided into specific categories                                                  h2u Exploration  uh2 list The world feels a little hollow and empty  Too many open and winding roads with no POIs  enemy NPCs  or interesting hey whats that The world needs more density   Many building types are copy pasted and have the same layout  Im surprised many people arent mentioning this because New World got obliterated for this same thing  Once youve seen a tombbasementdecrepit housecampsite  youve seen them all   The ancient spires  which have a Legend of Zelda dungeon crawler with puzzles feel to them  are very simple and lack challenge  Hopefully theyll add more difficult puzzles in later spires   You can simply break down doors that require switches  thus bypassing the puzzle altogether   While a neat concept  clearing a shrouded area and chopping the giant red shroud root becomes tedious after the 2nd time  They are not unique enough at this stage in the game  containing all the same enemies  aesthetics  and gameplay  Again  once youve seen one  youve seen them all and unfortunately Enshrouded currently locks skill points behind clearing them  making them more or less mandatory  Id like to see this system improved upon by adding in some of the puzzle systems from the ancient spires   The large overworld map lacks essential details like bridge locationsdecals once discovered  This should be painted into the base artwork of the map  The map also doesnt differentiate between biomes  The map only shows verticality and important POIs like shrines and quest areas  list                                               h2u Combat and Enemies  uh2 list Though simple  the combat feels responsive and fluid  All weapon types appear viable based on damage numbers   The skill tree is fun and offers unique gameplay experiences  but leaves me wanting more  I look forward to seeing this expanded   PvE and AI are incredibly underwhelming and simple  They often cycle between one or two attack animations  including special boss enemies   There arent enough mob types currently  After exploring the playable areas in EA  youll find the same enemy types scattered throughout  The ones that currently exist  look nice and polished   What enemy NPCs lack in mechanical depth  they grossly overcompensate in numbers and are overtuned  Even with food buffs and a tankier build  some enemies will still 1HKO  even if they are couple levels below    While Im sure a bug  enemies will often get stuck underground or on terrain    There is no CC or stagger protection after a certain point  Meaning if you get swarmed or cornered  you can easily be chain staggered to death   Dodge rolling doesnt roll through enemies due to collision  meaning if youre cornered youll likely be staggered to death  list                                               h2u Loot  uh2 list Enshrouded commits the greatest cardinal sin when it comes to loot  You can find epic and legendary quality items early on  only to replace them with an uncommon green a couple of levels later  Often the raw damage upgrade is far better than the minor perks from upgrading a lower level legendary weapon  It NEVER feels good to move from a unique legendary with a cool model to a common green because of numbers  Epic and legendary weapons should be saved for end game PvE and crafting   Looting items can add them to your hotbar with no option to toggle this off   Loot often feels underwhelming  I feel like after 22 hours  Ive seen 95 of the possible loot drops  At this stage  it feels like Diablo where Im waiting for a specific weapon to drop at higher quality for the extra upgrade slot  list                                               h2u Crafting  uh2 list Crafting is fine  What youd expect from a crafting survival RPG  is not bad  but nothing inventive either    Crafted gear options look nice and function well   The game offers a craft from chests system by requiring items be placed in specific magical chests  making other chest types completely obsolete  This feels redundant and should be the baseline for any chest   You cant salvage gear youve outgrown  Giving back at least a small amount of materials like cloth or metal scraps would feel better than simply being forced to delete the item  list                                               h2u Other  uh2 list I experienced very few technical issues   UI can be confusing and tedious with so many windows to cycle through trying to figure out what youre looking for    Gliding is quite fun and needed for a map with so much verticality   Fall damage is VERY unforgiving  sliding down a slope means taking massive damage once you finish sliding   The friendly crafting NPCs are slightly annoying  especially the blacksmith who is constantly berating you   Sound design is excellent   You can roll up a steep hill  while helpful  looks very unintended and goofy   Mining sulfur yields WAY too much EXP  Sulfur instantly breaks and yields 10EXP per swing  Within minutes ~level 10  mining sulfur leveled me up  I did this for several levels  as the EXP rate from mining sulfur felt more efficient than exploring and killing NPCs at my appropriate level  list                                               b TLDR b The game lacks density  difficulty  and depth  It needs more time to cook in the oven and needs to greatly improve upon its selection of enemies and their combat  I dont feel incentivized to explore  as even the later areas in EA share many of the same loot tables and gear drops from early areas   This game isnt bad  but I wouldnt say its great either  Right now Id rate it a 510  Id say wait at least 6 12 months before investing time and money into Enshrouded  I will revisit my review as the game updates                                                 Edit  Grammar  Edit 2  In response to some comments  these are my observations and primarily a list of things that came to mind as I was playing over the 22 hours  Youre welcome to like the game in its current state  and I certainly dont idislikei the game  however that doesnt mean I feel its recommendable as is  I love this style of game and would love for it to succeed  I have no problem supporting the game in EA and expect some hiccups  bumps  and incomplete gameplay  That doesnt excuse it from criticism as its still a product that I paid for  Nothing I saw in Enshrouded seemed particularly unique to make it stand out from other competitors in the market  This is primarily the reason I rated it a 510  as it feels middle of the road in its current state  I have played many games in EA  and most get better over time as development continues  As stated in my OG review  I will revisit upon subsequent game

158720426,76561198019405086,0,8,1275,0,1199,2024-03-10,english,"While I enjoy the systems and ideas Enshrouded brings forth  as of writing this Review I do not recommend the game due to issues plaguing the combat system  This is not a definitive Negative review  however  as these things might get patched  On to the review though   While  yes  the building is phenomenal and a definite step up with the creative freedom it brings it is the danger enemies pose which sours the entire package  Whether gathering materials  food or going for quests  you are bound to fight  The trouble here  though  isnt the ineffectiveness of the playstyles Magic  Melee  Ranged but rather the enemies themselves  I play solo  so the following issues arent derived from a poor connection or such issues     Wildly inaccurate tells for hits  Enemies attacks can be learned and dodged  but there are times where their reach is clearly excessive or the hit detection is not comparable to the visible model  A good example are boars  who have on one hand a predictible charge and a short range double swipe with their tusks   which does not deal damage after a wind up but immediately on Frame 1 of the animation  Going into melee here guarantees almost a hit unless you count the time between their actions as you cannot visibly gauge when the first of the two hits strikes  resulting in a very cheap hit   Another example is  in general  the humanoid enemies and how the parry window isnt clearly defined  There are bear like humanoids who can only be parried at the start of their attacks wind up  while the actual attack itself is already in an unparriable state  Shroud enemies and Scavengers parries tend also to be misaligned from their models  but here I have trouble getting consistent results as well     Being hit results in a light stun  One of the most frustrating things is that being hit does not mean being hit once but subjected to the rest of the attack sequence of the enemy  The on hit ston of any attack prevents rolling and blockingparrying  ensuring one mistake is paid dearly for  Some enemies have such multi combo attacks that you can lose over half your available health after being hit once   which is not ideal     The damage is at times excessive  Tying into the above  the damage dealt from those multi attacks is brutal  In this game  healing is not as feasible outside of spells and potions  both of which require resource gathering to provide sufficient numbers  The amount of healing provided is great  yet with being hit once consuming already the first type of potions entire healing capability you go through these quite fast  Farming in this game takes time and the quantity of resources needed for the average person to deal with the damage will be considerate   and that keeps one stuck in the gathering stage rather than exploring the dangerous places for loot and progression     Difficulty ramping  armor and content gating  Workstations are unlocked by exploring and finding key components to make them  These are often in the next highest level region than the previous  as expected  The same goes for the resources   and that is where most of the previous issues combine into a major problem  The armour you can craft is limited by the stations you have and the areas where you find the next components has enemies appropriate for that stations provided benefits  Or  in other words  you have to get the means to make better armor in regions where you already need them to survive easier  In solo I am almost required to cheese enemies to not get hit as I intended to play a ranger  but this just feels cheap and not rewarding  Going into melee  however  results in dealing with the jank I spoke of before and that cost me plenty of deaths  Since a lot of progress is done in ruins and places with little elevation I regretted my choice to play a ranger rather quickly as their armor is  as expected  in an even worse position than the tanks own    I will admit here that I am playing solo  that this is meant to be played with several people and such  yet I dont have the time to go online that often or more specifically  In a consistent pattern  That means some of my criticisms are part of the way I play  but this doesnt cause them to no longer be an issue  Whomever is going to play a Fighter  on  or offline  will deal with the janky melee combat anyways  The places you have to go to remain as dangerous and while many hands gather more you are bound to consume a lot more too   As others have said  the building and the rest of the game  especially the scope  are still impressive and will keep me personally interested for a good while  There is 100 a great time here  just at this time there are bugs and a lot of jank you need to accept for the time being  IF you read this far and are weighing your options  let me say this  I reckon these bugs and issues will get addressed in the future  so this negative review is just as temporary hopefully  I will update this review once these problems have been dealt with  though even now one thing I need to say clearly   If the above issues are nothing you are concerned with  I do recommend the game whole heartedly  I cant speak for issues with server connections  lag etc  but if the stated issues are sometihng you are willing to ignore  accept or work around  Go give it a shot",2024-02-19,2024-02-19,False,163,9,0.728187382221221924,23,True,False,True

genuinely surprised this game is getting Very Positive Reviews right now  Because holy shit there are some serious issues in the game that need to be addressed  And I have gone through the reviews and a lot of them are either kissing ass to the devs  heavily bullshitted  or just simply not real reviews      To keep it simple  Imma make a list of the major ithingsi meaning the good and the bad about the game that I have seen  and that give me the reason to make this review  And to lay out why I believe that despite the Very Positive reviews  why this game went from a huge 160k peak  to only 17k and slowly declining as the time goes by     h3Graphicsh3  Realistically Graphics arent really that bad  I will say that the game is visually really nice  with exception to the obvious visual glitches and bugs that most to all who play the game already know about  Especially if you are an AMD user like me     h3Building Systemh3  Personally this is where I strongly believe the game really shines  Think Minecraft    With a little bit of Conan ExilesArk  and a lot of Valheim  I love the detail that they put into the building system  and personally this has become my main and sadly only at this point favorite aspect of the game  The fact that you can essentially build bLITERALLYb anywhere on the map Whether its on a mountain side  in a valley  on a hill  IN the hill  or just completely underground is amazing to me  And hope that other games from here on out take from this    Because God it is a beautiful system  And the different sized blocks  from big to small  that allow you to add more detail to your building is the icing on the cake    h3The Combath3 Here is where I think the game slowly falls off    The combat has to be the most underwhelming aspect of the game    From literally the second you spawn in on a new character    To whatever level I am level 11 now at the time of making this    It literally feels like you never progress  because everything out there is always higher level than you and stronger than you the more you explore  The fact that I am leveling up  getting stats  getting food  buffs  armor  you name it    And I am STILL getting just absolutely destroyed by anything I encounter is ridiculous  Wildlife not a huge issue  But I am sick of exploring in the shroud or in a camp or whatever  and just immediately getting overwhelmed by mobs and just having to sweat and struggle to survive  ESPECIALLY when they are the same if not a couple levels above me Like what kinda system is that I get it if I wander into a camp with enemies like 4 or 5 levels above me    But 1 or 2 higher Come on    They shouldnt be just 2 3 shotting me like my metal armor is made of paper  and my stats dont mean shit  ON TOP OF why does it feel like my attacks literally do nothing to them Yet the smallest attack just obliterates me Doing my jump attack and I get slapped outta the air  or getting knocked down in the middle of attacks  meanwhile the player cant stagger enemies themselves What kinda combat is that Every time I go to fight something  I feel like I am playing Dark Souls and I need to do a bumb before I engage  Like holy fuck  tone it down and give the player something to work with Especially when they ARE JUST STARTING THE GAME We shouldnt be sweating the fights at level ONE   h3The FUCKING Staminah3 Here is where I feel I am gonna lose some people  but honestly I dont give a fuck because we are allowed to have our own opinions  And I feel there might be a few who will agree to this    Why am I bCONSTANTLYb battling stamina The amount of times I have died because I am just constantly out of stamina is insane to me  I feel like I am a morbidly obese 65 year old man with lung cancer chasing an ice cream truck I run out of stamina so fucking fast its not even funny  I will have 2 and a half circles  and I still run out in seconds during combat  Because its like EVERYTHING uses a FUCK TON of stamina  Dodging  blocking  jumping  running out of the way which you have to do because everything is if not equal  FASTER than you  Either get rid of stamina all together  or buff the fucking hell out of it  Because early on in the game it is nothing but a cancer  That or make it to where only certain things cost stamina and other things dont because holy fuck  That or make it to where you can get away from enemies without the need to sprint and use it up  because right now    This is a game killer for me    h3QuestingExplorationh3 So this one is kind of a 5050 for me  where the storyquest line whatever it is  I dont really pay attention to it isnt bad per se  it is executed poorly  And what I mean by that is  the quests themselves arent bad or hard    Its just    Why am I getting a quest for an area I am not supposed to be in yet Like getting the quest for the new Hollow Halls that for some fucking reason you decided to put in the bSTARTING AREAb of the game and all the mobs are in abundance and higher level As well as the exploration quests being in areas you cant access because of either too high level enemies  or its blocked by deadly shroud    Which makes the quest almost impossible to complete    Also  please    PLEASE for the love of god  add something that helps players find resources Something in the journal  more map markers that we can use to mark it when we find it  SOMETHING There are so many things in this game  and I shouldnt have to TAB OUT OF THE GAME to look it up    h3Certain Mechanical BugsIssuesh3 Now here is where I have had some of my biggest issues    Where either there is input delay in my controls ie  When I attack it feels like I have to wait like 5 seconds before I can jump  or else it literally doesnt happen  I spam the space bar  no jump     or when I shoot my bow and the arrow is like selective on what it hits And doesnt hit what I shot Like what the fuck is that  Why am I aiming at an explosive barrel and the arrow is hitting the thing that is 5 feet to the leftright of it I seriously cant make this up    The arrows literally prioritize OTHER things other than what you are aiming at  That needs to be fixed  And then the amount of times where I have seen mobs just slide themselves up cliffs to attack me cliffs a player most definitely could not climb himself  As well as the times where I try to go in one direction  and my character just completely either doesnt turn or just does some weird shit like when I am gliding  omg its the worst  There are a lot    And my god it is so bad and aggravating when it happens in what I like to call dire times Like in combat  or other character life threatening situations where you need to act fast    h2TDLR  For those who could care less to read my criticismsh2 At the end of the day I cant say it is a terrible game    It definitely has some good aspects to it  and if the devs actually work on it and notice the issues    It could potentially be a great game  But right now in its current state  unless you are willing to put the cold sweat and tears into actually making something in this game   OR if you actually have the people to play this game  I will admit with some friends you could have a great experience  But as a solo player talking to other solo players    This is not it right now  I am sorry but I cant recommend this title  Sure for 30 USD its worth the few hours to check out if you really want to    But to call it a great game Nah  not me bro  sorry  I am genuinely shell shocked that more people arent complaining about this   That or I wouldnt be surprised if people are and they are just being buried under all the game gud reviews   To each their own  hopefully this game will shine some day    But right now not a whole lot

need to be addressed badly  With a bit of luck  the developer will see this and hopefully some of these will be addressed   First  Building a base feels entirely pointless  Other than to look aesthetically pleasing and to put your loot in  they borderline serve no purpose right now  They cant be raided  they dont need to be defended and because you can only have 1 copy of the NPCs spawned in the world  you basically only have one base with the other bases acting as nothing more than fast travel points at best  These separate Bases you use as fast travel points can absolutely cripple the balance of the game as they allow you to do some pretty extreme exploits that instantly obliterate all difficulty and the worst part is  you can do this accidentally   Second  The NPCs feel completely pointless other than acting as an extra work bench you have to run to  Sure  they give you quests but for the most part  they act as another step in crafting that feels unnecessary  For example  in other games  you would make a basic crafting bench  then move up to an advanced crafting bench and then the best crafting bench  Each bench higher than the last allows you to craft all of the previous benches stuff and more  In Enshrouded  thats not the case  Instead  you have to craft a work bench  then the NPC  then the NPCs separate work benches to unlock crafting with the NPC AND their work benches separately  Its needlessly more steps   Third  Recipes can be incredibly inconsistent to unlock or even to make certain items  For example  You can unlock the Iron Pickaxe recipe by finding iron ore but the Iron Felling Axe isnt unlocked until you have metal bars  then when you do have metal bars  the Iron Pickaxe can be made without any special workbench but the Axe needs Smithing Tools which are way later in the quest line  The issue with this is because you gain XP through mining but not felling trees  you now have one of the fastest ways to gain XP in the game by just rushing to the end zone which is incredibly easy to do  mining some Iron and you can now get to the max level within hours mining copper in the beginner zones   Fourth  The entire point of the Red Fog confuses me  So its clear that the map is separated by lines of Red Fog to stop you from going to zones you shouldnt be in until you upgrade your flame    But the devs put shortcuts to get through the red fog such as bridges so you can easily bypass the red fog  This results in players being able to run to the right of the map where all the best loot spawns in chests and get end game gear at the start of the game rendering crafting largely pointless   Fifth  Because everything outside of your bases build zone completely respawns when you quit to menu and then boot your game back up  it means you can exploit the living hell out of the game and often without even meaning to  For example  there are a lot of unguarded chests in the end zone that drop max level items including amazing armour and the best weapons in the game  If you make a base near to those chests  you can just get the chests  go back to menu  open the game back up  go back to those chests and open them for another roll at whats in the chests all while keeping what you picked up last time  Within an hour of doing chest runs as a level 13  I managed to get the best weapons and almost the best armour in the game using this method and I only found out about it by accident  Because the game doesnt have a pause  whenever I would go to the toilet or need to take care of something  I would go back to the menu and in turn I quickly realised everything respawns  including chests  This can also be infuriating if you had to dig out parts of mountains to reach locations as you now need to re dig that out  This is also an issue if you just cleared out an area so you can mine or gather only to have to fight everything again   Finally  After getting some of the best armoursweapons and building up a massive base  I came to the realisation that there is absolutely nothing left to do  If you are unlucky enough to find a top tier legendary weapon early  there is literally nothing to strive for  It could be because I havent done many of the quests As they were rendered completely pointless by the loot system but from what I can see  there is absolutely nothing to do now  I know that the game is early access and while the game is much better than say Valheim  at least Valheim had base raids so you have to spend time making good bases and the difficulty of fights was still incredibly hard even against things you out geared   I hope these issues can be addressed as there is so much potential here  but right now there are also some pretty crippling flaws  I dont doubt that the devs care about the game  especially when compared to something like Valheim where the Devs have basically abandoned the game so I will be happy to come back to the game when its had much more time to cook but as it stands now  I would say hold off and wait for updates if any of what I said in this review is an issue for you ",2024-04-18,2024-04-18,False,8,0,0.562513768672943115,0,True,False,True

almost useless in this game  as all you need is quite small  simple house which might be in shape of a box for 5 NPCs and their stations  You dont need more bases  It doesnt even matter which building material you use  as nothing is attacking your base anyway  As for me  after finishing the current content of the game  I felt mainly disappointment and probably if I had played alone and not with a friend  I would not have made it as far as I felt more annoyed than enjoying the game  Still if you like casual survival games without a deeper goal  you might like this one   About stuff I dont like in this game  list Theres nothing challenging in this game   Bosses are a joke and there are only 5 of them  The most dangerous enemy is some green ork like berserker  but even he can be easily defeated   just jump on some roof where he cant reach you and you can easily kill him with any range weapon bow  wand  spells  And even if you die  you dont lose experience  equipment or anything of value  so death is just some minor lose of time here   Map architecture  This is the worst open world map Ive ever seen  And its not even generated  so someone made it like this on purpose Map consists of many bigger or smaller areas surrounded by vertical walls of cource theres no climbing mechanic here and usually only one way out    Very often if you want to reach some waypoint  you have to walk around some giant moutain or something    This is the most masochistic open world map Ive ever seen  It blows my mind what were developers thiking making it like that  One thing I can say for sure is that in most cases its not fun at all and often very annoying   Red floor that kills you instantly  Especiallly that its usually surrounded with vertical walls and you fall into it either when gliding with high speed into foggy enshrouded area and see it when its too late  fall into some random small hole in the ground during combat or fall while doing the next point  which is   Slippery slopes  This is one of the most annoying things in this game  You very often slide down when there is large curvature of the ground  very often falling into red floor which kills you instantly and even if you somehow survive  escaping is almost impossible as its ususally surronded by vertical walls     This mechanic makes it even more annoying to go uphill  so even if you find some slope that is not totally verical  trying to go uphill is great stuff for masochists  Sure you can use your pickaxe to flatten it or even make a tunnel to the top  but its tedious and not fun at all   Emptiness  Map is quite big  but what for when most of it is empty with no enemies and generally nothing interesting  Sometimes you run for a very long time witout any enemies in sight  even in enshrouded areas   Repetitive enemies  Lets just say that the same enemies that you fight in early game youll also fight in endgame zones    And no  they wont even have different color  size  equipment  speed or anything  they are the same mob  just with higher number next to their health bar     Poor itemization  Again  exact same weapons  just with higher levels  And there are not too many of them  Also they have quite boring atributes  There are no unique abilities   higer rarity weapons just have more boring attributes to unlock  Armors and rings are even more boring  as they cant even be upgraded like weapons   Boring quests  Mains story of the game is to find 5 NPCs and then find a bunch of stations for them    and thats it  Stations will allow you to process more resources  which leads us to next point   Not very useful resources  There is quite a lot of different resources and materials in this game  But there are not many ways to use them Usually youll just make some new armor  station or if youre archer you might need some of them for arrows    but thats it  In other cases most of them youll use once or twice and dont use for anything anymore   Music  In many great games  music can create a great atmosphere  Unfortunately not in this one  The music here is boring and not memorable at all   Bugs  bugs  bugs    And I dont mean critters  This game have some annoying bugs  The worst one is problem with connecting to server of unknown origin  Im playing with a friend and sometimes he joins instantly  but sometimes there are some connection errors and he cannot join  After many attempts he finally joins  but so far we havent found what it might depend on  And I found many topics about this with many players having same problem  So far no solution is sight    There are also many more or less annoing bugs    Enemies often spawn submerged into terrain   you cant kill them then  but they can still kill you    Sometimes health bars of your enemies stop showing up  Sometimes some objects like shrines or letters are invisible  Sometimes quests show incorrect location on the map  Etc   Quests and lore as plain text  Its 2024 and we still have quests in form of text    Even if World of Warcraft 20 years ago most players didnt want to waste time reading those  And in current times its not hard to use some text to speech tool not to mention AI to make it vocal  There is no need to immediately employ an army of lectors in several languages to do this   Logical elements  Its just a matter of taste  but I dont like logical elements in this game most of them are in Ancient Spires  Some buttons that you need to find and push to open a door    if Id like to play such game  Id play something like The Talos Principle  not and open world survival game     Illegible map  Map could use many improvements    For example why cant I name my own map makres And why my teammates dont see them Telling your friend about location you want to go can be challenging here    Why biomes are not distinguished on the map Why cant you zoom out map further Etc     Boring combat  When I played Vindictus for the first time  I thought that all games from now on will have such easy to learn and effective combo system if battles  Yet here we are 14 years later with same boring one button combat    Adding ability to dodge and parry is not enough to make combat interesting   Not many interesting skills in skill tree list  And now some things I think are above average compared to other similar games  list Building mechanic is quite nice but unfortunately as I mentioned before  theres no need to use it too much   Land leveling is also quite nicely done here  I like it more than in Valheim for example   Graphics are quite good   Gliding mechanic is quite enjoyable  especially combined with high Ancient Spires where you can fast travel  This makes it easy and in quite enjoyable way to reach many areas fast  If only there were more Ancient Spires    Grapling hook mechanic is also quite nice  but IMO its not used enough you can only use in fixed locations   I like the way you choose arrows and spells here by holding right mouse button and scrolling through them list  I know that game is in early access  Theoretically it has potential  but still requires a lot of work to realize it  And not just by raising level cap to 50 and filling rest of the map currently half of visible on the map world is not reacheble     Game needs a lot more depth in areas of  challenges  quests  itemization  skills    And some existing stuff like excess of vertical walls  red floor that kills you instantly or slipery slopes should be thrown out entirely  as all they do is irritation and they are not fun at all  Still while its possible  itd need a lot of work to make this game great  maybe even compared to progress that No Mans Sky did  Therefore  unfortunately  I am not very optimistic about the future of this game

crafting games  Enshrouded relies on a stamina system complete with dodge rolling however the stamina system is really only there to be a pain in the ass due to poor balance and implementation  Id like to be charitable and say that my problems with Enshrouded are mostly due to its Early Access state  but I cant  Theres no way the devs made this combat system or design encounters like this on accident   Jumping doesnt require stamina  but halts stamina regeneration for a few seconds  Climbing a metal grate drains stamina quickly  but climbing a ladder doesnt  Attacking doesnt cost stamina or interfere with stamina regen  but dodge rolling does  Dodge rolling doesnt provide any i frames and you often times will just get hit anyway due to poor enemy hitboxes   Ive actually performed sideways rolls that caused my character to loop all the way around the enemy and into their attack anyway  I wish I could say that I just made that up  but I cant   Many enemies are damage sponges that are capable of dealing lethal amounts of damage to the player in an instant leading to combat feeling like a chore  And you will be doing a lot of fighting  Those generic Scavengers youve been fighting Why not make one green and give it even more health  double the speed  and double the damage Those shroud beetles youve been fighting Why not make red ones that will explode when hit dealing hundreds of damage each  My level 25 character  with quite a bit invested into Constitution and good armor takes 297 damage from one of these things  Playing as a melee character Well enjoy the Kindlewastes where youre going to fight flying birds that are a pain in the ass to hit as a melee character because for some reason every weapon does horizontal attacks  Sure  you can stun them by parrying them repeatedly  but the parry mechanic  like nearly every other aspect of Enshroudeds combat is jank and unreliable  Those same generic enemies youve been fighting since the beginning will take 3x longer to kill in the current end game  even with level 25 EpicLegendary weapons and you will be fighting more of them at once   The lock ontargeting system in this game is a joke for all playstyles  but its the worst for magic  Even when locked on to an enemy  wands just have a mind of their own and will target enemies youre not even locked onto  The lock on mechanic loves prioritizing the enemy furthest  even when youre being swarmed by 10 enemies at a time  and you will be regularly facing very large groups of enemies  If you get hit by an enemy and are staggered this will cause the lock on target to change in most cases   Bosses are a joke  They deal high damage  but also move and attack much slower than many of the games most basic enemies  making what should be the appropriately challenging encounters  the easiest of all  I dont think combat will improve much as updates are rolled out   Together  the aforementioned aspects of Enshroudeds combat lead me to not respecting the games content  By the time I had progressed to the Nomad Highlands I stopped fighting enemies altogether unless I absolutely had no choice  or specifically needed an item that only enemies drop  An Elixir Well Just use the glider and skip right to the Shroud Root you can do this with most Elixir Wells  City full of Scavengers Just run past them and proceed to the quest objective or boss fight   Other aspects of Enshrouded are a chore as well  Want to build a house out of wood Well first you need to turn those Wooden Logs into blocks at a crafting bench and then use those blocks to build  An unnecessary currency exchange that made me stop building stuff after a while  Crafting stations  decorations  etc are all inventory items that can only be placed by equipping them to an action bar  which leads to a lot of menu hopping as you build and furnish  Theres no option to breakdown these items either  Its either delete it  place it  or put it in a chest  Contrast this with Fallout 4s building system where you have the option to not only scrap building pieces  decorations etc  but also the option to store these things and they are stored within the building menu itself   Equipment itemization is yet another chore  Crafting gear is mostly useless since it takes more timeeffort than farming chests  Since the game resets every time you enter your world  its much faster and much more effective to gear via chests than crafting  Chest rewards  poor rng aside  will yield superior equipment compared to what you can craft  Also  why cant I salvage a weapon  but not armorrings   I could go into more shit wrong with this game like the Hollowed Halls  but I should stop here  Enshrouded is truly a game of all time  but not one that Id recommend unless the developers do some major overhauls to various aspects of the game  Necesse  Valheim  Palworld are all better Early Access choices ",2024-04-14,2024-04-14,False,3,0,0.518518507480621338,0,True,False,True

feels a bit unfair  However i couldnt in all honesty give it a positive review either   Now  this game does a lot of things right  but it also makes a few humdinger mistakes    Lets talk about what i found good first   Performance  This honestly surprised me  I play on Legion Go handheld for the most part  and while i have to run at 1600x1000 on medium  i still get an almost locked out 60fps  When you move into a new area it drops to around 30 35fps for few seconds  but then jumps back to 60    The setting   Honestly the setting is for the most part one of the most interesting ones ive played for a long time  I loved flitting around the different time lines to do stuff  In a crude way it reminded me of the Dishonored 2 time mechanic  only more janky and not as fun   Despite that though it was still intersting enough to keep me playing  Along with the portals to other areas and times  Sure its nothing really special  but it was implemented and used in a way that made it satisfying   The Classes   Honestly  this was the one and only area where this game trounced Diablo 4  All of the classes were fun to play  and more importantly  were HELLA fun to play Honestly no matter what class i played i got into them and had fun  This was especially true with the skill system  and the way you could expertise and make a skill your own  For example i came accros a unique mace that had a 26 chance of casting spreading flames  which pretty much would wipe out groups  i was able to turn my skill  which was a pure physical skill  into a burning skill  and when further speciallised it combined with the mace skills and made me a walking fire god  Was amazing fun  The various classes all have several routes you can go with and it genuinely feels like its your class  It was very immersive  and a satisfying    for a while  More on that in the down side below   Sadly  thats where the good stuff ends  Now lets talk about the meh stuff   Controller support  It has it  which is a step in the right direction  but my god is it janky AF  You can not rebind the A button for some reason  and the way its implemented looks weird on the UI  Whats more theyre using some weird auto targeting to help you out with controllers  However it never really works right  for example if your surrounded by low level zombies and the flying critter that summons them  For some reason the auto target decides to target the zombies  and getting it to targert the flying summoner is a battle in and of itself   Sadly it gets frustrating  battling the on screen enemies  and the secret enemy that is the auto target    The loot  URGH  Why do all ARPGs have the same issue when it comes to loot  they dont seem to learn from each other  THe loot in this game are frankly  garbage  I went from level 12 to level 45 with the same sword because EVERYTHING that dropped for me was hot garbage  Now yes  id built the sword using the crafting system  but even so going that many levels without a real upgrade was depressing   The loot filter  Let me be blunt  if you have to use a loot filter to see the loot you need or want to see  then you Fed up  Last Epoch takes that to a whole other level  There are youtube videos over an hour long going into the complexities of the filter system  and its still confusing AF  The sad thing is though YOU have to use filters because 99 of the loot that drops is pure garbage and isnt even worth taking for selling because its only worth a coins   The crafting  No explanation  no tutorial  no nothing  just a go use the armoury and that was it  No explanations or anything  And while you can mostly figure it out  it would be nice to have a proper explanation from the game   The story  The story itself is disjointed  has holes so wide you can drive a truck though  And frankly so badly voice acted that whenever someone spoke i was cringing and space baring thorugh as fast as possible to get past it  I gave up with the story in the end  which is just as well given the ending and i use that term loose as possible   Microtransactions  Or imo NOT so micro  The people whine about the cosmetics in D being expensive and they are but seem to give the devs here a pass  When in fact IMO the devs here have made things worse  D4 at least allows you get cosmetics for EVERYTHING in game  However here thus far atleast  after over 30h  all cosmetics have to be bought with cash  Want a cloak  go pay for it  Want a pet  or new look  go pay for it  Whats even worse is that these cosmetics are only available if your playing online I dont mind paying for cosmetics  but NOTHING should be locked behind a pay wall  Though to be honest  for the most part the cosmetics are pretty trash   Devs dont respect your time  This for me is one of the worst  The maps are pretty large  and frankly exploring is fun  However i no longer bother exploring because it feels like a waste of time  You do occassionally come accross the odd chest  but it will only have a few coins and a load of trash items  Whats more if you teleport out for whatever reason  when you come back the map is 100 reset and your exploration is wiped out  Not good Also if you left some items behind while you went to vendor your trash ARPG staple there well guess what  not only is the map reset  mobs respawned  but all that loot you left behind is gone  So  after all that  no i dont recommend the game  If it goes on a 50 off sale then sure pick it up  because i have had some fun  But its not worth its asking price  i certainly dont reccomend the deluxe ot ultimate

clone with a linear progressing storyline spreaded out over an overcomplicated map that kinda spans over multiple timelines  It could have been a simple line with multiple points representing the various steps from timeline to timeline  Each time you log back in the game you are hinted towards which timeline you were last but then you have to zoom over all areas of the map one by one cause even there they could not make a single developped map  Its a mess  its bad and counter intuitive   The skill trees are not that complex but there are many of them since each main class and specialist class got a passive one plus each ability of these classes got one also  making this game a very build oriented type where you can really choose whatever aspect of your class you want to expand upon  Supporting this is a weirdly made item forging system that looks complex and impressive at first but its mostly just an over complicated lottery system where you are tring to influence the stats on your gear  shaping the item as much as possible towards what you want before running out of tries  after which the item is meh and you sell it to the merchant or break it down into components   Again  in support to all of this is   for gods sake i never saw that before    overwhelming loot showers that you have to filter with yet another complex but useful system to sort those showers cause loot is all over the place  Uniques are handed to you like candy and will leave you completely unimpreseed after a while  This is awful  never seen before mounds off loot that you can break down for specific components to play forging lottery   With that in place you spend a couple hours going through the storyline   and around what i estimate to be halfway through the game around level 50  the linear story is replaced with a roguelike map system where everything is randomly made up of all sorts of mobs and tilesets that dont fit together  I say halway on a base of 100 levels but im not sure if theres a cap since the difficulty can be ramped up by applying corruption on those roguelike scenarios as you please  You will play for a while   up till you cant take it anymore  was lvl 80 for me  At that point leveling up was extremely tedious and all you get is a passive class point since your 5 chosen skills the ones you actually play with are maxed up at lvl 20  You can replace any of those as you wish but youll have to farm up a little to get the new skill up to max level   I will say the skill system is really well made  it allows you to try each skill and max them up to see if it suits your playstyle and choose another one if you want  Note that all progression is lost when you remove a skill from a specialisation slot though  which is forgiveable when you think that some games are forcing you to start new characters to check out other skills  Passive class points are also undoable requiring gold only   With that said the whole experience is rather boring and bland  The repetition is awfully painful and thats even before reaching the endgame    i havent seen the end of the story and im fed up with the repetitive bullcrap that was put there for maximum play time  The boss fights are horribly long you can build up your character to be awesome  wiping out masses of mobs in a click but when you enter a boss fight you become extremely weak and although your resistances are maxed and more than maxed you still get one shot by a lot of their attacks  Only some of their attacks are telegraphed and even then they dont always give you time to get out  Theres also a stagger system  interrupt or whatever that is clearly audible as a metal on metal sound that is usually followed by the death screen  Not sure what it is but it does interrupt whatever you were doing  stopping you in your tracks  Its not a stun since this one has an icon over your head and paralyzes you for an uncomfortable amount of time    In the end  the boss fights are ruining everything as they are extremely nasty choke points  highly repetitive like most content in this game  I miss the good old games that had am evolving storyline across multiple locations with twists here and there  I didnt mind restarting the game 2 and 3 times at a higher difficulty level to eventualy max out my character  then going for endgame stuff  Today i was served a very bland  repetitive

159945381,76561198099084972,0,2,12011,0,10487,2024-03-15,english,"I would have given this game a thumbs up while it was in Early Access  but now Id recommend that you wait and see if they ever actually finish it  Ive myself played over 120 hours a few years ago when I purchased the game  and have given 1 0 and the two hotfixes they made to try and fix some of the game breaking bugs introduced with it roughly 45 more hours  Im rank 9 in the SSF faction they added this patch  I will leave out any launch related lag and connectivity issues  as you could simply wait those out  The online version of the game works pretty much as intended now  bugginess aside    There are both good and lacklusterbad aspects to LE as it stands now   First  the GOOD     For ARPG veterans  this offers a relatively laid back and forgiving learning experience  For new players  it might even be the best because its not entirely boring with its simplicity  The skill trees are split up and there shouldnt be much that forces you to document yourself through a third party  There is also an in game guide that will provide you with a significant amount of information for your build or to understand how to chose and craft items andor build in order to progress  It doesnt cover EVERYTHING  but if youre already doing fine with the bulk of the knowledge that it contains  you should be fine figuring most of the rest of the quirks out     The combat itself is not bad  Its slower  less snappy and more floaty than PoEs  I have 8000 hours in PoE over 7 years  I am an expert when it comes to PoE theorycrafting and economic know how so it is my best comparison  Some builds play very smoothly  and its quick to get going and to feel like youre doing a good job blasting through zones killing monsters  This is not what warrants the negative review  I would say the price point is very fair for both the feel and variety of skills you can use and tailor to your liking  Its not stellar  but it does not pretend to do an amazing job either  You are also MUCH less likely to brick your build and get walled off by a difficulty spike than in PoE if you dont look up a guide and do your own thing as you go  You respec your character passive points instantly through gold again  from a casual players perspective this is great  and your skill points passive through experience this isnt as great   That is all for the solid points that help me feel like I paid for an actual finished product  Now  the BAD     The assets and artstyle feel cartoony  blocky and childish  There is very little consistent soul and personality to the design of gear  minion and enemy models  If you pay attention  you will realize that through the polish  you can see all the cracks that the small dev team had to gloss over and relay to the back of their ever growing  neverending to do list that I personally wouldnt be very proud to have at this point  considering they announced selling a MILLION copies  While the lighting effects and many VFX are absolutely fine and up to par with modern games  especially those made with Unity  There is a plethora of horrible models  rendering issues  strange fluid movements  animations that look like default place holders just look at any group of 2 campaign NPCs or more in town  you will understand what I mean  No less than half the 3D models and assets just look uncanny and cheap if youre used to larger studios games  There is music  but I cant remember a second of it even though I work with music professionally and have studied it  Its bland and doesnt stand out  much like most of the art in the game  The rest of the sound design is at times crisp and satisfying  at times barely acceptable  The voice acting simply sucks for most of the characters and bosses     The UI looks decent  however it is littered with bugs and feels clunky much too often for a 35 USD full release  You will encounter typos and grammar mistakes SEVERAL times each hour because the code that makes them display is bad and doesnt account for plural cases  for example  The chat window is badly coded  sticks to your screen when you load into zones and doesnt save your settings from zone to zone  which means you have to click it once per map if you want to talk to your party members rather than in the Global channel  All this ultimately adds up and has contributed more than Id have originally thought possible to making me drop the game     The endgame content loop feels unfinished and lacks replayability  I know ARPGs are about doing the same stuff over and over again  dont worry  I know what you can and cant expect from an ARPG  You are expected to take risks and invest time to gather rewards  and cant expect too much hand holding  In LE  once you grind monoliths enough and get some of the items you were target farming  all thats left to do that is worth your time is to push corruption and try to get that small upgrade on your Legendary item or your next build  BY DOING MONOLITHS AND 1 DUNGEON over and over and over and over and over again  Getting decent gear is very easy and a breeze  but getting your final upgrades can take weeks of doing literally the same thing every 5 minutes endlessly  I cannot stress this enough  try blasting through monoliths for 6 hours straight at a fast pace  then failing 3 cache rolls in a row and tell me you arent going absolutely insane as someone who doesnt play this game on stream for a living  There are missions that youre strictly better skipping if you value your time  because they take much longer and dont reward you more  Half the rewards from end game monolith bosses are simply X or Y drops Z more commonly  If PoE only had maps and lab Im really trying to pretend half the dungeons and Arena are even worth a second of your time here  Im being generous  I wouldnt be playing it anymore either  Keep in mind that 3 YEARS ago monoliths were functionally the same minus some QoL changes  a couple unimpressive extra missions and bland enemies  and some pacing adjustments  For a big 1 0 release update  this feels like they forgot to actually include the final update content to me     There is no straightforward road map for the future  whether that is for seasonal content or expansions  Their approach has been thanks for paying guys  we appreciate it  youll get more endgame when we manage to make it  XD  Needless to say  I feel like this is a risky developer player relationship model to tolerate as a player  Maybe somewhere in 2025  we will have seasonal content  they will have patched all thats wrong with the current 1 0 release  and well have 1 or 2 extra endgame bosses  That is honestly all that you can expect as a potential customer  considering that I barely got anything worth my while in 3 years of development  They have released the final two classes and made them completely busted  and thats honestly not a problem since they are the bulk of the new content theyve been promising us for almost a year now  Those  along with the new factions  are the only thing returning players get to look forward to  If I specced into the Merchants Guild  then saw that there are NPCs for EVERY single item base type in the game  and that you have to physically walk between them to shop  and if I saw that there is no Redeem all button to get all gold from your sales without clicking 50 times  I would have been angry  Ive instead taken the SSF approach and Im so far not disappointed  even though its simple and bugged   In conclusion  There are reasons why someone would want to buy this game and play it for a couple hundred hours  Its not entirely bad  But man does it ever feel unfinished and do the decisions taken by the devs and the art team feel lazy and half hearted  If youre expecting this to replace insert your favourite ARPG here  dont get your hopes up  If youre just trying to find a comfy game to spend 35 on  this could interest you but it will get frustrating WAY faster than you can imagine   xox",2024-03-06,2024-03-06,False,167,19,0.619240105152130127,24,True,False,False

feels a bit unfair  However i couldnt in all honesty give it a positive review either   Now  this game does a lot of things right  but it also makes a few humdinger mistakes    Lets talk about what i found good first   Performance  This honestly surprised me  I play on Legion Go handheld for the most part  and while i have to run at 1600x1000 on medium  i still get an almost locked out 60fps  When you move into a new area it drops to around 30 35fps for few seconds  but then jumps back to 60    The setting   Honestly the setting is for the most part one of the most interesting ones ive played for a long time  I loved flitting around the different time lines to do stuff  In a crude way it reminded me of the Dishonored 2 time mechanic  only more janky and not as fun   Despite that though it was still intersting enough to keep me playing  Along with the portals to other areas and times  Sure its nothing really special  but it was implemented and used in a way that made it satisfying   The Classes   Honestly  this was the one and only area where this game trounced Diablo 4  All of the classes were fun to play  and more importantly  were HELLA fun to play Honestly no matter what class i played i got into them and had fun  This was especially true with the skill system  and the way you could expertise and make a skill your own  For example i came accros a unique mace that had a 26 chance of casting spreading flames  which pretty much would wipe out groups  i was able to turn my skill  which was a pure physical skill  into a burning skill  and when further speciallised it combined with the mace skills and made me a walking fire god  Was amazing fun  The various classes all have several routes you can go with and it genuinely feels like its your class  It was very immersive  and a satisfying    for a while  More on that in the down side below   Sadly  thats where the good stuff ends  Now lets talk about the meh stuff   Controller support  It has it  which is a step in the right direction  but my god is it janky AF  You can not rebind the A button for some reason  and the way its implemented looks weird on the UI  Whats more theyre using some weird auto targeting to help you out with controllers  However it never really works right  for example if your surrounded by low level zombies and the flying critter that summons them  For some reason the auto target decides to target the zombies  and getting it to targert the flying summoner is a battle in and of itself   Sadly it gets frustrating  battling the on screen enemies  and the secret enemy that is the auto target    The loot  URGH  Why do all ARPGs have the same issue when it comes to loot  they dont seem to learn from each other  THe loot in this game are frankly  garbage  I went from level 12 to level 45 with the same sword because EVERYTHING that dropped for me was hot garbage  Now yes  id built the sword using the crafting system  but even so going that many levels without a real upgrade was depressing   The loot filter  Let me be blunt  if you have to use a loot filter to see the loot you need or want to see  then you Fed up  Last Epoch takes that to a whole other level  There are youtube videos over an hour long going into the complexities of the filter system  and its still confusing AF  The sad thing is though YOU have to use filters because 99 of the loot that drops is pure garbage and isnt even worth taking for selling because its only worth a coins   The crafting  No explanation  no tutorial  no nothing  just a go use the armoury and that was it  No explanations or anything  And while you can mostly figure it out  it would be nice to have a proper explanation from the game   The story  The story itself is disjointed  has holes so wide you can drive a truck though  And frankly so badly voice acted that whenever someone spoke i was cringing and space baring thorugh as fast as possible to get past it  I gave up with the story in the end  which is just as well given the ending and i use that term loose as possible   Microtransactions  Or imo NOT so micro  The people whine about the cosmetics in D being expensive and they are but seem to give the devs here a pass  When in fact IMO the devs here have made things worse  D4 at least allows you get cosmetics for EVERYTHING in game  However here thus far atleast  after over 30h  all cosmetics have to be bought with cash  Want a cloak  go pay for it  Want a pet  or new look  go pay for it  Whats even worse is that these cosmetics are only available if your playing online I dont mind paying for cosmetics  but NOTHING should be locked behind a pay wall  Though to be honest  for the most part the cosmetics are pretty trash   Devs dont respect your time  This for me is one of the worst  The maps are pretty large  and frankly exploring is fun  However i no longer bother exploring because it feels like a waste of time  You do occassionally come accross the odd chest  but it will only have a few coins and a load of trash items  Whats more if you teleport out for whatever reason  when you come back the map is 100 reset and your exploration is wiped out  Not good Also if you left some items behind while you went to vendor your trash ARPG staple there well guess what  not only is the map reset  mobs respawned  but all that loot you left behind is gone  So  after all that  no i dont recommend the game  If it goes on a 50 off sale then sure pick it up  because i have had some fun  But its not worth its asking price  i certainly dont reccomend the deluxe ot ultimate

someone elses solved build and thus not encounter as many bugs   Most of the issues I wouldnt mind so much if they were the only issues  but its everything as a whole that makes the experience thoroughly frustrating   Fun enough at surface level to experiment  but endgame just frustrating between all the bugs  server issues  and game locking up in various ways  More depth than D4 but not polish   Less depth  less polish than PoE  Servers dumpster fire during prime time   Complaints   I keep occasionally picking LE back up but theres always something broken  If youre lucky enough to live next to the servers   great  cool  Grats  Ive tried all 3 NA gateways  it says I have 38 42ms  and they all stutter  rubberband  kick me back to login on zone transition  or infinite load if Im not playing during off hours like weekday mornings or after midnight in NA  The game may have just launched but its been in public beta for almost 5 years now  Multiplayer betas been out for a year  Yet  the fanboys are out in droves proclaiming that Small Indie Co  EHG can do no wrong and there is naught but glorious potential  When will that potential be realized   Certainly  the bugs are to be expected  and there are many    Conversion skills are plagued with tags not applying Healing Hands Fire  Rogues Fire   Lightning explode or like Decoy Totems cold conversion not being affected by cold damage  Theres many known issues going back to 2021 that havent been fixed    or have been fixed  once upon a time  but have re emerged  Falconers node that gives you a spectral falcon on dive bomb desyncs frequently and then you dive bomb for 0 dmg until relog  The Homeward node in Healing Hands occasionally makes you do 0 dmg until relog    Ive played ~8 different builds so far   respeccing is really easy   but not a single one was bug free  But  they were all viable to clear the campaign and early monoliths maps with up til corruption 300 or so  Build viability is initially peak  but unravels as you push corruption  Yet theres no compelling reason to do so  Theres no overarching endgame loop outside of pushing higher simply because you can  And  unless you abuse ward generation  theres little consistency when doing so   The servers are a mess still  Load time seems predicated on server load  Infinite loading screens on the weekends  Todays longest was 18m  Faster to alt f4  reload game  try again  Multiplayer is a mess  You can portal to a friend and then just get stuck in no mans land  https imgur comaWyo2UVE  Parties sometimes dissolve between maps  Cant talk in party chat if the party icons arent present  despite being partied  If you load into a map before your party icons do  you appear as minions to the other player  You can get split into separate instances if 2 ppl enter a loading screen at the same time  Theres anim lock issues where you just suddenly freeze  die  and cant do anything until logout  The boss fights have a 1 death policy where youre supposed to stay dead until your party members finish the fight  but depending on lag you can resurrect multiple times  If you wipe  you can race to your friends portal while theyre load lagged and rejoin  You can die  but not die  and run around using skills at 0x hp   requiring a full client reset  With trading  theres rampant dupe exploits  nvm the billion npcs with individual auction houses  or that you have to pull from your stash   invent   AH instead of stash   AH   Im sure some of these things are on the list to be addressed  but that doesnt make me any happier playing the game at the moment  Its just frustrating playing MP    Offline singleplayer isnt plagued by the server issues but it still has no compelling endgame loop and no compelling way to target farm specific uniques  Sure you can narrow it down to only uniqueset hats  but enjoy all those 1LP necro hats on a rogue  The pool is still way too massive  way too diluted  It feels balanced for trading  whereas CoF is the SSF afterthought    LEs crafting is very approachable as a new player  Its more centered around finding somewhat usable items and then chaos rerolling affixes or using 25 pls dont use FP scrolls  Theres some metacrafting mechanics with splitting bases  sealing affixes  running the T5 experimented dungeon forgot name  or with like preparing bases to fuse with high LP legendaries    But trying to fine tune items in the endgame sucks a fat one    Its so much more annoying in that if you hit 0 FP thats it  the items bricked no matter what  In endgame this means you need to prepare multiple bases  hope it hits those 25s  hope it doesnt ping you with a couple  17 FPs  hope stuff doesnt whiff  etc  Theres so much layered RNG on top of getting good T7 affixes on the right base that its like just so suffering when youve gotta repeat that process for every slot   PoEs endgame crafting is a clusterfsck no doubt  but theres almost always a deterministic path forwards even if that path is Farm currency and buy it  mirror it or lock suffixes as a half way point and then gamba  Its far easier to make 90 items in PoE via ess spam on fractured items than it is to make the equiv in LE    Crafting early game  D4  LE  PoE Mid game  LE  PoE  D4 Endgame  PoE  LE  D4  LEs currency has so little use outside of being fodder for Lightless Arbor gambling  Economy exploits keep devaluing it for player trading    CoF Prophecies seemed fun at first alt faction to trading but then frequently drop duplicates of the same terrible sets  uniques  2LP common  but 3 giga rare  and 4 might as well not exist  Can target farm by picking a specific monolith set to run  coupled with prophecies  but results still heavily rng and not a good use of time vs just buying it via trade faction  Can swap factions at any time  but items dropped from CoF mechanics are bound to the faction level they were dropped at  which is stupid frustrating for rolling alts or swapping factions since your items may as well just not exist if you cant use them until purple rank 8 regardless of level req  If anything  CoF should have higher rates to compensate  not be punished   Losing all your loot on deathportal is annoying given all the serverbug  related deaths  Particularly if you need to path through a given area bc now you need to rerun it from the start  but also get no reward for doing so  No map permanence  if you port out to take a phone call or something  maps gone  Can also die after completing a map and lose all ground loot  monolith reward   Offscreen dots in high corruption particularly frustrating on dodge based builds  Cant block dots  Glancing blow doesnt apply hit based reduction  1 tick often enough to tick your entire hp pool on a rogue  Falconers bird dash skill Aerial Assault comfy but not worth using in high corruption since no invuln on movement  Fixed animation   you die regardless of dodging  This sort of endgame style pushes all builds to become bruisers or abuse ward generation mechanics  Shifts invuln doesnt prevent dots from applying  it only prevents the damage  The cleanse is applied at the start of the Shift  so if a dot applies during movement  itll immediately tick after the invuln window wears off and kill you  Some mechanics predicated on movement speed like rotating dot beams  Server lag  fuzzy hitboxes  frequent deaths despite being adjacent to beam  Sometimes beams hit through terrain   inconsistent behaviour   Having to loot potions is the dumbest thing ever  The text is so tiny  The potions frequently drop offset to the text and you cant loot them if youre not standing on them  regardless of where the text is  Theres loot all in place for shards and gold  idk why it wouldnt suction up potions with that too  or why filters cant

clone with a linear progressing storyline spreaded out over an overcomplicated map that kinda spans over multiple timelines  It could have been a simple line with multiple points representing the various steps from timeline to timeline  Each time you log back in the game you are hinted towards which timeline you were last but then you have to zoom over all areas of the map one by one cause even there they could not make a single developped map  Its a mess  its bad and counter intuitive   The skill trees are not that complex but there are many of them since each main class and specialist class got a passive one plus each ability of these classes got one also  making this game a very build oriented type where you can really choose whatever aspect of your class you want to expand upon  Supporting this is a weirdly made item forging system that looks complex and impressive at first but its mostly just an over complicated lottery system where you are tring to influence the stats on your gear  shaping the item as much as possible towards what you want before running out of tries  after which the item is meh and you sell it to the merchant or break it down into components   Again  in support to all of this is   for gods sake i never saw that before    overwhelming loot showers that you have to filter with yet another complex but useful system to sort those showers cause loot is all over the place  Uniques are handed to you like candy and will leave you completely unimpreseed after a while  This is awful  never seen before mounds off loot that you can break down for specific components to play forging lottery   With that in place you spend a couple hours going through the storyline   and around what i estimate to be halfway through the game around level 50  the linear story is replaced with a roguelike map system where everything is randomly made up of all sorts of mobs and tilesets that dont fit together  I say halway on a base of 100 levels but im not sure if theres a cap since the difficulty can be ramped up by applying corruption on those roguelike scenarios as you please  You will play for a while   up till you cant take it anymore  was lvl 80 for me  At that point leveling up was extremely tedious and all you get is a passive class point since your 5 chosen skills the ones you actually play with are maxed up at lvl 20  You can replace any of those as you wish but youll have to farm up a little to get the new skill up to max level   I will say the skill system is really well made  it allows you to try each skill and max them up to see if it suits your playstyle and choose another one if you want  Note that all progression is lost when you remove a skill from a specialisation slot though  which is forgiveable when you think that some games are forcing you to start new characters to check out other skills  Passive class points are also undoable requiring gold only   With that said the whole experience is rather boring and bland  The repetition is awfully painful and thats even before reaching the endgame    i havent seen the end of the story and im fed up with the repetitive bullcrap that was put there for maximum play time  The boss fights are horribly long you can build up your character to be awesome  wiping out masses of mobs in a click but when you enter a boss fight you become extremely weak and although your resistances are maxed and more than maxed you still get one shot by a lot of their attacks  Only some of their attacks are telegraphed and even then they dont always give you time to get out  Theres also a stagger system  interrupt or whatever that is clearly audible as a metal on metal sound that is usually followed by the death screen  Not sure what it is but it does interrupt whatever you were doing  stopping you in your tracks  Its not a stun since this one has an icon over your head and paralyzes you for an uncomfortable amount of time    In the end  the boss fights are ruining everything as they are extremely nasty choke points  highly repetitive like most content in this game  I miss the good old games that had am evolving storyline across multiple locations with twists here and there  I didnt mind restarting the game 2 and 3 times at a higher difficulty level to eventualy max out my character  then going for endgame stuff  Today i was served a very bland  repetitive
