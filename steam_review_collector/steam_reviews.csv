you are supposed to hit a wall and restart from day 1. when you do that all your monster info gear and facility upgrades stay. employees do restart at level 1‚Ä¶but you can be more careful and pick ‚Äúsafer‚Äù monsters to make your next run easier.\n\nthird you are expected to micromanage a ton of things at the same time but the game specifically makes it hard to manage those things. employees have health and sanity bars but they are constantly spewing random nonsense in a bubble [b]that covers up their stat bars![/b] do you need to pull one of your guys out of the fray because they have 2 hp? dunno‚Ä¶maybe you should be paying closer attention to said dude‚Ä¶meanwhile a spore escaped while you were not looking and killed 5 people. it‚Äôs like having an arena full of 3-year-olds all screaming for you to play and pay attention to them. monsters do operate by a very specific script‚Ä¶and once you know that script intimately it does become a little easier. but you won‚Äôt understand how annoying some monsters are until later and they can make your days very hard (see reset to day 1 option).\n\nlastly [i]lobotomy[/i] does not believe in quality-of-life game elements and views your time as a player as a resource it can abuse for no good reason. take the hp bars again‚Ä¶even if your dude isn‚Äôt spewing nonsense about band camp while trying to fight [i]nyarlathotep[/i] you have to pause and zoom way in to see how they are doing. when baddies spawn you have to scour the entire facility zooming in and out to find them‚Ä¶and hopefully they aren‚Äôt hiding in a hallway transition. finally in some fights you are not allowed to use the game speed up option. speeding up does nothing to help you win it's quality-of-life to move through the rote & boring parts quickly. nope the game wants you to suffer. why do so many devs not realize those ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù straight up make their games less fun?\n\nthe eldritch horror themes and dystopian story were decent. i saw where it was going pretty quickly but there were still a few twists i didn‚Äôt anticipate. the story rambles more than it should and can be a bit hard to follow at times when it decides to wax philosophic.\n\ni did start to enjoy the game once i learned enough about the game and monster scripts. then i was able to handle difficult situations relatively easily. i reversed my decision back to dislike when challenges wouldn‚Äôt tell you what was going on‚Ä¶and your only clue was in subtle things you ignored for the whole game because they were meaningless before. 90% of people are going to get frustrated and look it up on the internet long before they actually figure it out for themselves. i do not like it when games make it hard for you to figure out what is going on.",2023-12-29 05:43:09,2023-12-29 05:50:14,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,4,False,False,False

(which also is incorporated into a cool abnormality! if you know you know.)\n	the old testament theming of the game is also quite interesting and unexpected for a game like this. the first abnormality you get in the game kicks off this theme and is iterated upon by the most threatening one. the characters are themed after biblical (angels? i don‚Äôt know much about this. might be more jewish rather than christian as well.) and it's well implemented. the story also goes into this in interesting directions in particular the themes of suffering and original sin being mirrored in gameplay somewhat. the theming of this game is original intentional and tightly woven into the experience. very well done.\n\n	speaking of by far my favorite part of the game is the warning level. if you fuck up in some way either by letting an abnormality loose or having employees die the warning level increases which plays banger music and also has some minor gameplay effects. for the most part the warning level is a gameplay way to signal to the player how messed up the facility is and also cause a snowball effect of failure. i don‚Äôt like the snowball factor that much but it is in the end interesting which is the end goal of any game. \n\n	\n	so yeah kind of a messy review. i really can‚Äôt say i recommend picking up this game off of steam. if it was free i‚Äôd say it has interesting ideas that are worth experiencing but if you want a game from this company of a similar or higher quality level that's actually worth your time and money i‚Äôd more recommend library of ruina‚Ä¶ even though i despise it and everything it stands for due to it being a turn-based rpg card game deck builder. \n\n	overall here are my generalized scores that arent really relevant to anything but my own general thoughts on the game. don‚Äôt compare these to scores from other people or even myself on other games. \n\n	personal scores: (overall about a 7-8.5 that fluctuates depending on how cool i think nothing there is that day)\n		fun: 6/10 dwarf fortress does cbt better\n		autism-ility: 8.5/10 was my hyperfixation for a while \n		aesthetics: 7.5/10 accurate corporate hellscape \n\n	somewhat objective scores: (worse than the sum of its parts due to its overall low budget and poor usage of that budget. about a 4 overall)\n		sound design: 4/10 red dawn.\n		game feel: 5.5/10 aggressively mediocre but buggy. commanding an army of goobers is never not satisfying but it toes the line in this game due to how janky combat is.\n		game performance: 3/10 holy fuck how do you fuck this up that bad\n		writing: 8/10 story stuff is fine but the stuff that's hidden in flavor text is great\n		horror score: 8/10 can be actually spooky at times\n		art: 7/10 has a style and is just‚Ä¶ fine. game looks bad. \n		the grind: 2/10 is real. and bad. \n		theming: 8.5/10 goes for something particular and nails it even though it's not that fun of an idea.",2023-06-25 11:46:50,2023-06-25 11:46:50,False,1,1,0.484650105237960815,7,True,False,False

too many problems build up as i went through the game but incase you do get the game my best advice to give would be this.\n\ndon't be afraid of replaying/restarting even from day 1.\nthe games expects you to use memory repository and the only thing you will lose from going back even to day 1 are the employees that you hired and the abnormalities you obtained.\nhowever any items and/or information you obtained from those abnormalities is kept.\nmission progress/completion is also kept even from day 1 resets this makes replaying the game significantly easier so do not be afraid of this or losing employees.\n\nwith that said i actually have a fair amount of nice things to say about the game so let's start off with the\n\n+++positives+++\n\nthe thematics of the game are great!\ni thought the general aesthetic worked really well both for budget reasons and as an intentional style.\nbut beyond graphics there's a lot of horror vibes the store description doesn't lie with what it's inspired by i really liked the scp vibes throughout.\n\nspeaking of scp's the abnormalities are numerous and varied i loved how different a lot of them were and it was surprisingly satisfying figuring out how to manage them all and in the end profit off them.\n\nthe story was also pretty neat though i can't go into depth about it.\ni found my eyes glazing over it a smidge with how it was worded at points but overall i liked how dark it was throughout and how things played out with all of the characters.\n\nlastly the music was also pretty cool at points.\nfor the most part it was kinda samey unless things were going wrong but when things were going wrong it got pretty good.\n\nnow onto the \n\n---negatives---\n\nthe games performance is terrible specifically as you progress.\nwhat started out perfectly smooth devolved into low framerates as the facility expanded to the point where even loading screens came close to crashing the game if i clicked or alt tabbed.\nthis is a problem when you're faced with combat because when particle effects happen the game practically freezes momentarily but everything is combat has particle effects.\ndamage prompts insanity prompts blood splatters everything will cause lag if you use large groups.\nnow while small groups have their benefits being discouraged from using a large group because the games performance will just die along with all my lower level employees feels terrible.\nbut even outside of combat scrolling across the facility is laggy animations get less smooth and for the late game objectives specifically it just feels awful.\n\nto go more in-depth on combat it's really simple. you select employees and you can tell them to either go to a location or attack something and later on in the game you get bullets which let you manually target people to give them shields health sanity or just kill them if they start to become troublesome.\nbut my problem with combat is that it's too simple i cannot tell an employee where specifically i want them in a room i can only tell them i want them in that room. so when i'm fighting an enemy and i want to move them to the other side of said enemy i have to select the employee tell them to go into a room on the other side of the enemy (assuming there even is one otherwise their only option is to either get hit or leave the room entirely) wait for the employee to move select them again and tell them to attack the enemy.\nit's tedious it's clunky and it's one of the reasons i disliked when the game decided to delve more into combat specifically.\n\nspeaking of those objectives from earlier throughout the entire game you're given missions from different people in the facility culminating in a final objective from them. these started off perfectly fine but the last few in particular were just awful.\ni will spoil three of these in particular but these are not major plot spoilers just gameplay ones.\n[spoiler]starting with the disciplinary team i don't understand why they had boss fights be the days objective instead of just collecting energy the game is not built for boss fights as it just devolves into kiting attacks over and over even with your best units. but for your units which aren't the best you just kinda have them on the side lest they die and ruin everyone elses sanity.\nit's a boring fight which you cheese either via kiting or through some other method such as unleashing abnormalities to the work for you which sounds like a smart use of mechanics but it's pretty dull [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]next is the record team this one is just dull. it takes away your ability to pause and manage things (to an extent) but it also removes your ability to speed things up opting to speed things up gradually as the day goes along. i find this extremely boring as most abnormalities don't use time as a mechanic so it just makes the day go extremely slowly and if you need to restart you'll feel every second crawl on by. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]finally we have the extraction team another mission that requires you to finish a boss fight instead of getting enough energy so what this means is more kiting to avoid attacks. the gimmick with this boss is cool you cannot hurt the boss until you deal with specific abnormalities that get put into a meltdown state.\nonce they're vulnerable you have a good chunk of time to wail on them. there are several problems here. she can place her meltdown effect on abnormalities which are already on cooldown meaning you need to wait unnecessarily before you can send someone to deal with it and when the boss becomes vulnerable they stop for a long while even if they're in a doorway transition where you cannot reach their model. if you do not deal with them in this state there is a good chance they'll throw out more meltdowns again all because you literally could not reach them because the game didn't allow you to.[/spoiler]\n\nand going back to general gameplay i really wish the game had more automation.\na lot of days i was just going through the motions it would've been nice if there was some way i could just automatically send people to go do the jobs i would like them to do. replaying days felt boring because very little changed and as the facility expanded the fatigue really set in.\n\nand speaking of the facility i mentioned how i loved the variety of abnormalities earlier but sometimes the game can give you some abnormalities you're just not able to deal with at points.\nsome will get out because you have too many clerk casualties one will get out because you don't have enough clerk casualties some will get out because your employees are too underleveled or undergeared and in the worst case scenario you're getting them on days where a checkpoint is set and going back to said checkpoint fixes nothing. going back isn't bad but the reason for it can definitely feel bad.\n\n>>conclusion<<\noverall there was a lot i like about the game and it started off real strong but it just became so tedious and annoying with what i wanted from me later on.\nit's not devoid of quality and it definitely appeals to some people but i find that it was more annoying than anything else in the later game for me to recommend this personally.",2023-02-24 09:00:06,2023-02-24 09:00:06,False,157,4,0.860116958618164063,11,True,False,False

you can speed up time in this game but not nearly enough. eventually even 2x/2.5x is wildly insufficient for how tedious much of the management phase becomes. \n\n[mod full fix] - very poor conveying of (very important) statistical information to the player. part of the game is obviously to let the player become a manager of a huge byzantine facility and make the best of it. lc however takes this to excessive lengths. the game plays around with giving the player access to information as part of research/story progression (hp/sp of agents/abnormalities as part of a research from one of the ais). lc however does not give info on shield hp/sp numerical hp/sp of agents/abnormalities numerical use-speed/range of weapons numerical success probability with fully understood abnormalities... this is extremely important information to properly manage the facility!\n\n- very poor conveying of spatially-related information. the game will not notify you if someone in the facility is taking damage / in combat nor will it tell you how they died. i suppose this could be a deliberate design decision but it is one that is hugely irritating to me personally. i much prefer the rimworld method of alerting you to threats. also agents can stack on top of one another and then you cant easily see their hp/sp\n\n[mod partial fix] - many models do not display the correct weapon your agent is holding which can cause confusion in the middle of an important suppression.\n\n- again personal opinion but the way the story is conveyed is very very poor. others might not mind this more scattershot type of storytelling.\n\n[mod partial fix] - unacceptable performance issues that can cause memory leaks. i was shocked to see >95% ram utilization (out of 32gb ddr5) by this game one night. be aware you will probably have to limit your play time to a few hours to avoid this. there is also generally poor optimization.\n\n- no spoilers but a good number of the ordeals/bosses in this game are simply boring timesinks that are occasionally frustrating and generally tedious exercises in kiting for minutes on end. late game can be pretty egregious in this regard\n\n- no spoilers but some abnormalities are genuinely run-enders if you are unlucky with their placement or just rely on frustrating mechanics to not cause immense damage (like getting normal results only). getting enough abnormalities that care about agent/clerk deaths can cause spirals that go on to cause resets as well though this is eventually mitigated with execution bullets.\n\n- eventually ~75% of your abnormalities will be completely ignored in favor of more dangerous (more energy producing / more efficient training) abnormalities. i feel this is a missed opportunity wherein we the player have no reason whatsoever to interact with the vast majority of the facility. \n\n[mod full fix] - this game is already painfully tedious and (imo) pointlessly time consuming after enough time has gone on that the players has a good grasp of the game. why can't i queue actions? some consider this part of the management process i consider this forced boring busywork.\n\n- you have no idea how long an agent has been using a tool abnormality and so have to: 1. guess or 2. using a separate abnormality as a makeshift timer or 3. use a real world timer (hope you are not at 1.5/2.5x speed \n in game!). this has genuinely been a huge headache on every run.\n\n[mod full fix] - training employees is a near complete guessing game. perhaps i missed something but until i read the wiki outside the game itself i had not idea how my agents stats were being changed as a result of work/suppression/gifts. this is again very important information that the game doesn't tell you. i feel like im seeing a rather unfortunate trend for a management game.\n\n- this one is subjective but i feel the way clerks are handled is very strange and could have done with a some overhauling. essentially clerks provide you with buffs some of which are fairly important. but eventually you will probably have to cull very large portions of them (usually with execution bullets) to prevent abnormalities from breaching as a response to too many clerk deaths from abnormalities or other events. so you can:\n1. not cull employees and so risk breaches which will probably kill clerks and reduce/lose buffs.\n2. cull employees and so diminish breach risk but also reduce/lose buffs.\nthe player is put in a situation where they have buffs when they least need them (start of day) and dont have them when they most need them.

not at all. it's like this for a reason; and often you're treated to much more refined artwork. \n\nthe abnormalities also look fantastic especially the more involved ones. even with the simplicity almost all of them have unique looks for when they breach unique killing animation and effects; everything is just so bespoke. it's a wonder to look at.\n\nevery abnormality has a little tale associated with them which you unlock as you learn more about it. the writing quality is perhaps not as good as over at scp wiki but then again what is? many of them are at least somewhat interesting and shed light on the strange beings that you have to manage. \n\nand then there's the music. for the most part you'll just hear the same tune (with minor variations) over and over and over and over make it stop and over and over. i have no idea what it is with east asian indie games and excruciatingly repetitive music/10 second loops. but of course when the music stops looping and you get treated to some special tunes they're incredible bangers so you can't even turn the music off.\n\n[h1]genius or fool; they both find madness[/h1]\nnow let's get to the main part. the gameplay. it starts out very engaging. you send your guys to an anomaly sometimes stuff happens sometimes people get hurt; you gain p-boxes and unlock new info about the anomaly or perhaps its associated weapons. you upgrade your guys you get new anomalies. you do the quests given to you by the sephirot (npc managers). everything's fine.\n\nuntil slowly but surely anomalies become harder and harder to manage. people die and you don't know why because you need p-boxes to figure it out but you need successful work in order to get p-boxes. what a conundrum. then suddenly a new ordeal shows up and kills your entire department because you didn't know what it was and wasn't prepared. this causes this strange new anomaly to breach containment and you have to redo the day.\n\nthis game is a paragon of anti-quality-of-life. many higher threat anomalies require conscious action from you the player to be managed correctly/to avoid breaching. you forgot to look at this thing and click here in the last 60 seconds? here is a train that kills half of your facility. you worked with this anomaly too many times with this person? dead. you used a person with the wrong stats? dead. or worse. breach. or both.\n\nafter a while your brain gets torn into pieces trying to balance your attention between the myriad of threats. and since later on there are anomalies that breach when people die (anywhere anyone) it's entirely possible for a simple mistake to snowball into total annihilation. so you have to redo. redo redo redo. 40 minutes of gameplay down the drain. and again again again.\n\nyou could say that this is actually genius. managing dangerous anomalies is supposed to be difficult. but no. the problem here is that you can't delegate can't automate; everything has to be done meticulously by hand day after day. and each mistake is more costly than the last. and the days get longer and longer; easier and easier to slip up...\n\n[h1]deeper circle of sheol[/h1]\nat this point i should note that this game has a story. it's a ridiculously grimdark story about human folly; but it's good. it's so good. you want to see it you want to know. you want to understand the mystery. but in order to do that you have to not only progress with the days - all 50 of them - but also complete sephirot missions as you go. those missions often require you to complete a day under extreme conditions which make the already difficult game a true piece of hell. \n\ni tried. so so many times. that's why i have those 134 hours. because i actually wanted to see what this is about perhaps to get good at the game. but no. maybe it's me. maybe my brain is just to distracted to play this game. and i tried. keeping notes developing protocols; it felt way more like work than my actual work. no. no more.\n\ni implore you: do not play this. or else you'll be trapped in the same loop of despair as me. i managed to break out but i'll always carry that seed with me seed of the ultimate sin of game design: a game with so much unfulfilled potential. let this review be an attempt at redemption and perhaps and act of deliverance from this torment for someone else.",2022-06-20 16:57:10,2022-06-20 16:57:10,False,107,71,0.701455891132354736,0,True,False,False

but can be improved by utilizing the horrors in your base - as your agents interact with the horrors you unlock understanding which is initially used to find out more about the creature in question (what kinds of interactions are more likely to be successful what happens when it gets mad any gotcha's that might exist etc.) but later can unlock themed weapons and/or armor. these are pretty much universally better than your starting gear although some may come with downsides as well. agents train up their stats through usage - the more they interact with horrors the higher their stats. at certain stat intervals they'll gain levels which makes them overall more competent/less likely to panic.\n\neach department also has a coterie of assistants - these are npcs that are always armed with the default mib gear and tend to die horribly whenever something goes wrong. keeping them alive gives various bonuses depending on which department they're part of; but losing them doesn't affect your bottom line like losing agents does.\n\neach day gives you an energy target with a bonus of any missions which you may have unlocked from your ais. as your agents interact with the horrors you'll eventually trigger an agitated state - random rooms in your base will start a countdown. failing to send an agent to them will at the very least cause a loss of energy; beware that some horrors are not appreciative about being ignored.\n\nas i mentioned in the opening the problem with the game is that the only way to figure out about a new horror is to send an agent in to have an interaction with it (instinct insight attachment or repression) and see what happens. sometimes things go fine and you can use the understanding you earned to unlock sections of the horror's profile. sometimes things go wrong; and when things go wrong in this game it often means that an agent dies.\n\nthe worst however is when things [b][i]appear[/i][/b] to go right but actually you've just triggered something - for instance maybe the agent that just went into that room cannot interact with any other horrors for the rest of the day or they explode (actual example). or maybe the horror will appear to be happy but if you've used an agent with a specific stat level higher than 3 there's a good chance it'll go wild breaking out of its room and sucking the brains out of your employees (actual example). these are the real killers because on later days you're scrolling all over your facility and while you might watch any interaction with a new room closely if it looked like things went okay you probably ordered your agent off on another errand and when they fall over dead for (apparently) no reason you'll have no idea what you triggered to cause their demise.\n\nyes you can eventually unlock the information you need through successful interactions with the horrors; but you might lose multiple agents doing so. losing agents reduces the funds you receive at the end of the level. funds are primarily used to buy new agents so losing agents causes a spiral where you're forced to replace losses with less and/or more poorly-trained agents. the alternative is to replay the day (which the game makes very easy to do granted) using your newly-gained meta-knowledge to avoid whatever costly 'oopsie' that you originally made... or you go to the wiki.\n\nso the problem is that human lives are simultaneously both cheap (in that agents tend to die fairly often) and very expensive (it costs funds to replace agents and it can take days to train their stats back up); and the only way to learn about the new horrors that you're constantly shipping in is to poke at them and see what happens... or look at the wiki; which defeats the point of the 'exploring the unknown' nature of the game.\n\noverall if the theme sounds interesting i'd say it's worth picking up on sale to fool around for <2 hours then make the decision if you want to put in a refund or not.",2022-01-10 11:45:37,2022-01-10 11:45:37,False,66,6,0.690154850482940674,0,False,False,False

positive feedback loop with the most trial-and-error gameplay in the entire medium.[/b]\nstat too low when working on an anomaly? insta-gib. stat too high? insta-gib. your unit got a trait which disallows them from certain work types or working on other anomalies? insta-gib. worked on the same anomaly too often? gib. working on an anomaly deals one of the four possible damage types which the unit has no defenses against? gib. escaped anomaly or boss fight has a surprise aoe attack with one second wind-up that gibs your entire crew unless you manually order your units out of the way? gib. an anomaly that spawns in random area when it escapes and attacks the entire facility every few seconds without any safe spots with damage numbers that instantly make all but the best agents die on first shot? gib-gib-gib. \n\nthere's no way to know any of these rules before you [i]successfully[/i] research and fight an anomaly multiple times. this isn‚Äôt like xcom invisible inc. or many other roguelites / permadeath games that do often throw curveballs for players to manage. ‚Äúmanage‚Äù being the keyword as in you can figure out a counter through skillful play or ample preparation. lobotomy corp‚Äôs most used curveball is an insta-gib with no recovery other than save-scumming. these kind of brutal surprise mechanics in themselves would be fully congruent with the themes of the game and the supposed expendability of your crew ‚Äì not to mention you get to hear the great alert tracks when things start going bottoms up ‚Äì but combined with the aforementioned extreme positive feedback loop it means there‚Äôs no way you aren‚Äôt going to be constantly save-scumming to hell and back.\n\n[b]you know what‚Äôs also fun in management sims? functionally horrid ui? shoddy controls? combat that requires precision perfect positioning? how about all of them at once?[/b]\nunits standing in the same spot have their sprites and hp bars cover each other and there's no quick way to find out their current status at a glance ‚Äì a simple list with filters and ‚Äújump camera to unit‚Äù command would‚Äôve been enough or having the overlapping units‚Äô hp bars stack on top of each other. there‚Äôs no control groups either no order queuing and worst of all units automatically unselect after you give them any order. \n\nthis is especially bad if you send your units to fight enemies with attacks that affect the entire room or when you get one of the events that spawn enemies in all parts of your base and requires you to spread out. it‚Äôs a visual clusterchuck that requires precise micro-management. the way you issue move commands is also not ideal since you can only designate rooms and not the exact spot where you want units to stand which is paramount of importance when some late game threats unleash the aforementioned 1-hit kill aoe attacks that require your units to be out of way when it happens.\n\n[b]several bosses and threats end up turning into silly elevator shaft-pause boogaloos.[/b]\nto elaborate some enemies either only spawn in hallways and deal humongous damage or instagib your units if you‚Äôre trying to fight them from the front or they have a massive aoe with a second or two of wind-up that hits your *entire base* horizontally at the boss‚Äô current floor and kills all but the highest level and best equipped agents in one shot. the solution?

(and just to be clear i refer to x-com in the base/personal/resource management aspect not the tactical combat)\n\n\n\nmy favorite part of ghost stories (or we can call them supernatural horror/thrillers if you prefer) is watching the characters try to figure out the mystery of how things work before they're killed. it's dark and scary but also an intense mystery. \n\nnow suppose someone has a hundred of such stories with all the mystery and investigation and personality and risk. now imagine they've got a vision where some poor manager is put in control of a containment facility where all these creatures are housed and he has to use his brave vulnerable employees to learn as much as possible about these creatures before they destroy everything. \n\nnow take that incredible vision with the countless wonderfully imaginative stories... and cram it into into a buggy tedious poorly translated overpriced phone game. my friends i give you lobotomy corp.\n\n\n\nthe mystery of figuring out the monsters is extremely good. the writing would i think be pretty good if it wasn't deeply scared by a poor translation. the base-management would be challenging but the challenge is destroyed by a super-simplistic metagame (you keep all your info and gear when you reload or restart). the gameplay itself is horrible. \n\n\n\n\n\n(i've rewriten my review after getting to understand the game a bit better although most of the actual info is the same. the original is below if anyone wants my first impressions)\n\nthe things that are good in this game are very very good. and the things that are bad are very very bad. i'm really torn on what to rate this. i almost requested a refund at first but now i find myself enjoying it. i think with some more polish on the playability the game would be truly outstanding. but it didn't happen and i as-is i think it'd be far too frustrating for any of my friends to enjoy.\n\nthis is a game about learning your way around these supernatural monsters. they aren't lovecraftian -- they aren't frighteningly alien they're frighteningly familiar. you progress through positive interactions with them but poor interactions cause problems. meanwhile you're building up a knowledge bank (both in-game and in your head) while trying to manage personal experience and equipment. you can save and load freely and most resources carry over from one playthrough to the next so you are constantly progressing as you play even if you lose repeatedly. \n\nfor the details... since most of the reviews talk about the good i'll start with the bad. \n\ni can't even describe how clunky the controls are. the player doesn't have trouble getting guys to do what he wants but it is so  needlessly complicated. you can't get a list of everyone in the base. you can't get a list of idle characters. if you don't know where a character is in base there's no way to find them. and when assigning characters you can't see all the teams at once so no matter the situation you have to do alot of clicking to get things done. it would be so easy just to have a menu with an overview of characters and monsters that would add so much. it might have been an attempt to simulate the inagility of a large corporation (and there may be upgrades later that i haven't gotten to improve things) but wow it's just difficult. if the base size keeps scaling up the late game is going to be an incredible pain to manage.\n\nnext the english. lots of people complain and there are some quotes that say it's better now. i don't know what it was before but it's difficult now. not game-breaking but challenging. it creates another layer of difficulty that doesn't need to be there. do a search for their manual and skim it you'll get the idea -- in-game information is extremely important and just as confusing. \n\nnow the flip side of the bad english is that it's a game about exploration and figuring out how to survive in a hostile confusing universe. in some ways the broken english almost adds to that element. i still think it'd be better if the devs did a better translation but the broken english isn't all bad. \n\nfor the good... \n\nthe game has a great depth of monsters and they are deliciously diverse. i've played alot of games and i'm not sure i've seen one with this much personality in years maybe decades. the best thing i can compare it to is the variety of races and ships in the old star control 2. complex asymmetric nuanced unique and so full of personality. i'm not sure but i think i'm less than 1/3 of the way into the game and if this game keeps up the pace it may be truly epic. on the other hand if it doesn't it'll become painfully grindy.\n\nthe gameplay when not being limited by the clunky controls is interesting. the monsters are fierce and unforgiving. there are lots of things that can go bad and when they do they can be very very bad. there's some things (including some very routine things) that cause instant game-overs without warning... it would be horrifyingly unfair if there wasn't an easy reload button. instead it feels like you're dealing with the supernatural -- you gotta handle em right. and even with the reload it still is difficult to get through unless you're shamelessly save-scumming. \n\nin terms of replay value... this game is all about knowledge so once you know how to handle a monster their interactions become routine and that happens fairly quickly. there's a finite amount to see and once you've seen it all i can't imagine there's any reason to keep playing. however the game (so far) appears vast and talking about seeing all the monsters in this game might be like finishing all the quests in skyrim or perhaps like having heard all the questions in a version of trivial pursuit. for example i've played through the first 15 days about 3 times now and i think i've seen maybe 25-30 monsters with only 1 or 2 repeats. they seem to come in tiers too so i expect the novelty will continue for the quite a while. \n\nthis game offers you a vast world to explore full of personality and challenge. but the exploration is about the only big thing it offers. it's one big learning curve and outside of seeing new things the game is pretty grindy and difficult to play. with that said i still think i'm enjoying it more than not and i'm curious to see what's deeper in. nonetheless i think the less eclectic people than myself might find this game quite unpleasant. if stumbling through interactions with an unforgiving set of supernatural creatures sounds intriguing then i think you'd also find the game fascinating. just be aware you have to fight through some unpleasant gaming to see it.\n\nbut whether you like it or not i doubt you'll find this game forgettable.",2019-02-22 14:16:54,2019-02-25 10:46:24,False,26,6,0.56237107515335083,0,True,False,False

[b]they show screenshots with all these different rooms but they are functionless. you don't use them.[/b] you can't click most of them and you certainly don't place anything. the same end-means mechanic could have been accomplished by much simpler means. i could go on and on.\n-in the end i figured out 'how to play' but you will spend a good bit of time pouring over the help file. between the poor translation and non-intuitive gameplay things are just confusing. i mean you are trying to 'get energy' from monsters by doing weird stuff. the monsters could be a naked lady a pair of shoes or even an old lady. too weird.\n-the ai text in-between levels seems meaningless and could just be left out.\n\n[b]the ugly:[/b]\n-why-oh-why do they space out the functional rooms (ie. monster rooms) so far apart?? it's insane. did nobody playtest this? so you have to have the screen waayyyy zoomed out to see two rooms and therefore you have to squint to read any text and can barely make out what is going on in the room. this gives me the impression that it doesn't matter what is really going on in the rooms. fyi i play from the couch on a large tv.\n-twenty dollars is an insane asking price.\n\n[b]totally hold off on this one.[/b] too weird and rough around the edges for the high asking price.",2017-01-09 03:30:01,2017-01-09 03:31:56,False,77,1,0.598941147327423096,9,True,False,True
