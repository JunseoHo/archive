There are 2 issues:\n\nIssue #1: The language in the (updated) EULA that you need to Consent to monitoring while you play this. I understand that this is because of the Butcher's Circus (multiplayer) DLC, but it's not well defined, and was instituted after I bought the game, and that's not cool (I have never agreed to the updated EULA).\n\nIssue #2: This one's harder to understand unless you've played Darkest Dungeon already, because:\n--> The artwork is excellent.\n--> The narration is top-notch.\n--> The H.P. Lovecraft-inspired story line is dark & creepy & awesome.\n--> The mechanics are challenging (and I really like turn-based games), the heroes varied, and the build-up of your party is neat & interesting.\n\nAnd yet, I'm at the end of this game after many hours, and it simply... stops being fun to play. It screeches to a totally un-enjoyable halt. I actually have stopped caring if I finish Darkest Dungeon, and I'm not really interested in its sequel(s).\n\nIt's not that it's too difficult (you learn throughout the game that it is very punishing, and that's kind of the point - you still play *because* of this), but rather it eventually becomes a tedious grind for its own sake. I also understand completely that real life is absolutely like this; sometimes bad things just happen and all the best-laid plans get blown to pieces by some seemingly random event (and again, in a dark, hope-deprecating plot, this is one of the major points), but it doesn't make for a good gaming experience, or at least, one that I want. \n\nSo, in the end, a great deal of this equates to the game simply just wasting my time, which is something we all get less and less of. Thus, my overall feelings on Darkest Dungeon have soured (because of the above 2 issues), and I can't bring myself to actually recommend it.",1711898111,1711898111,False,561,20,0.818795859813690186,19,True,False,False

Up against the 86 week time limit and with 8 heroes already dead, I wiped on the final boss of the very last dungeon and 86 weeks of game-playtime - many days of real time - went down the drain. It took me seven years to recover my morale enough to try again.\n\nYou start the game with two heroes, always the same two guys, Reynauld the kleptomaniac crusader and Dismas the cheating highwayman. In other games of this sort your heroes are always straight-backed courageous fellows who are in it to the end, but in this game your adventurers have quirks which are sometimes good, and sometimes bad (like being a kleptomaniac, or a known cheat). As they adventure through the dungeon they get stressed out and sometimes they'll crack and develop afflictions which cause them to behave strangely (and poorly) in combat. (Occasionally the stress will make them true heroes. But not very often.)\n\nIf they survive, they can perform stress relief activities like grabbing a drink, gambling at the bar, praying to their gods, other things of that nature, and recover enough to maybe go back and try again. New heroes will come to your Hamlet on the stage coach, ready to fight and die for you, and you will build parties of four and send them out every week to explore the dungeons, get gold and trinkets, level up, and upgrade their equipment at the Hamlet (which you also upgrade to get better heroes, better equipment, better skills, and better stress relief activities). Ultimately your final goal is to go into the Darkest Dungeon, four times, to stop the unspeakable horrors that dwell there from taking over your world.\n\nDeath of a hero is almost always permanent, and on Stygian difficulty if you lose 12 heroes the game is over, or if you take more than the 86 weeks the game gives you the game is over. (You can play on lower difficulties which have no time or death limits, if you want. That turns the game more into a rogue-lite than a rogue-like. That might be your cup of tea.)\n\nOn my latest playthrough, I triumphed against the final boss with 2 weeks to spare. It felt good. Really good. On the old road, I found redemption.\n\nExcellent game, stressful, but it is great fun to work your way through the combat puzzles, so to speak, and slowly get better and better at finding hero and skill combinations that let you tear through the inhabitants of the various dungeons. The dungeons ramp up in difficulty as your heroes level up, and they will refuse to go back to dungeons that are too easy for them, so you have to get better. The champion difficulty dungeons, for level 5-6 heroes, are very, very tough, especially the bosses. I tend to lose my heroes at the beginning, when they are level 0 nobodies, and at the end, when the highest level bosses expose the weaknesses in my old strategies.

Luck and randomness are parts of many games and can lead to unexpected and fun outcomes, but it can also lead to frustration. This game focuses heavily on gauging percent chances to hit, which can be a fun and strategic system; However, there is randomness that can lead to bullshit moments. Even though you have a 90% chance to land a hit, you miss three times in a row and low roll your corresponding heal, losing a hero as a result. Or, several enemies crit your hero at the start of a darkest dungeon run, killing the hero and requiring you to lose another hero on retreat.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, random quirk and disease distribution at the end of a dungeon can be brutal. It is frustrating when all of your heroes acquire a random disease, plus detrimental negative quirks, that you now have to spend money and time to remove. Negative quirks and diseases cannot be healed at the same time, and so you have to commit at least two days plus the gold cost.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the second issue of grinding. There is a significant amount of grinding required if you want the best chance of beating the game, or if you lose high level heroes. This is especially true with the crimson court DLC. This grind is often fun due to the enjoyability of the core gameplay loop, but tedious at other times (such as attempting to get invites to the crimson court, grinding gold, or raising a hero back up after losing one).\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nAlthough the game is not perfect and randomness can be infuriating, Darkest Dungeon is worth playing for its fantastic gameplay loop and incredible atmosphere.",1709484980,1709484980,True,32,0,0.764380455017089844,0,False,False,False

The more you play this game, the more lessons you learn, the more you learn about what is best and what enemies to focus down, and what trinkets to go fore.

The gimmick of the game is that you cannot prepare for everything (unless inordinate quirk locking be considered a virtue), the trinkets always have some kind of downside (or kind of useless when they don't), but the good thing is that having stuns, lots of damage, speed, accuracy, some healing and some stress healing and camp skills to heal stress makes the game a lot more managable, so the conclusion is that you want to look out for heroes that have the aforementioned things and don't interfere with each other's positioning and always can do something useful in case you get surprised or shuffled. Another factor is more related to your personal blunders like forgetting some provisions like Blood or shovels and what not, or starting a fight you can't finish (Shambler, Collector) or having to abandon the mission because your team comp couldn't get to the boss room with little damage, or letting a hero get an affliction (this usually causes a domino effect and you'll probably abandon the quest soon).\nOnce you harness the game mechanics and RNG to some extent, the game becomes really enjoyable. The only feasible downsides are probably grinding level 6 heroes and RNG screwing you over on a rare occasion (like your level 6 Flagellant  with 87% deathblow resist dying on the first death's door check, have fun spending an hour or two grinding a new hero with good quirks!

Not today[/h1]\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\n[b]Darkest Dungeon (DD)[/b] is a unique game, as I never played a game as punishing as this one. With the sequel recently being released, my interest was piqued to try out the first game that I happened to already own but never spent much time playing, and I'm glad that I took the opportunity to check out this gothic-themed experience.\n\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Interesting gothic based story\n[*]Fun but brutal gameplay that is very punishing\n[*]Upgrades for your heroes, town, and more\n[*]Beautiful 2D gothic art style\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Playing this game can be a chore at times due to the needed grind\n[*]There are times when you will be reliant on RNG and it might screw you over\n[*]Activating some of the DLCs on your first playthrough is not recommended\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story starts out with a man known as the [b]Ancestor[/b]; he learns of this special power that is somewhere deep in his mansion. He then uses up his family’s remaining fortune to hire people to help him dig up this mysterious power. However, it turns out that this power was something worldly and he ran from the dungeon. Only the [b]ancestry[/b] survived and he wrote a letter to the next heir of the family, to fix the mistake he made. After he sealed the letter and before the angry mob of villagers that were mad for what he did could get him, the [b]Ancestor[/b] had ended his life.\n\nThe story for [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is not fully told to you directly, rather, it’s told to you at different points in the game, mainly before you do boss missions. It’s interesting at the very least and I like the gothic [b]Cthulhu mythos[/b] theme it has going for it. Although [b]DD[/b] takes inspiration from the [b]Lovecraftian[/b] universe, there are also different inspirations that are included as well. The heroes you hire also have back stories to them as well.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay for [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is fun but also very challenging and at the same time, it can be very difficult to grasp. There are many mechanics that you yourself have to try and get used to. You will be able to hire different heroes that each have different abilities for them to use. Each of them also may have a different mechanic that corresponds to them, however, they all do share the stress feature. Stress in the game is determined by what the hero goes through in a given situation. When stress reaches 100, that hero will have a certain negative Affliction inflicted on them, like them being fearful, paranoid, etc. \n\nHowever, there is a chance that some heroes will be given a virtue when they reach 100 stress, they get increased stats and will randomly heal themselves. So, while most heroes get afflictions and break, others will use their stressful moments as something to encourage themselves. If a hero gets to 200 stress, they will lose the virtue and go back to zero stress, while those with afflictions suffer a heart attack.\n\nDuring combat, your heroes can do certain attacks or abilities to buff/debuff allies or enemies. Each hero has a certain amount of health and it does vary, when their health runs out they will be put under a [b]Death’s Door[/b] status. When they are in this state, they will suffer state penalties and they have to go through a test to see if they will survive the next attack. I should note that if your hero is at 1 health and the enemies attack them with a move that does a lot of damage, they will tank the entire attack except the one damage. The only way for a hero to die is by failing the [b]Death’s Door[/b] test.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995283070\nIf a hero suffers a heart attack while at [b]Death’s Door[/b], they will be killed immediately, when a hero dies, they are lost for good and will also lose the equipped charms they have. You can recover them if you lose a hero in battle but if it’s outside of one, they are gone completely. So pray that your best heroes survive the attacks and that their stress does not get too high.\n\nThere are ways to relieve stress, like taking out enemies or using a camping ability at a campsite. If your heroes survive the mission, you sent them on, you can send them to a few stress-reducing activities like making them meditate, drink at the bar, gamble, pray, etc. There are also times when a hero will get a disease, so you must take them to the [b]Sanitarium[/b] for them to get cured. A hero can get a max of three diseases, if they happen to get another one, it will just replace one of the current diseases they have. Last I checked diseases don’t necessarily work like that but who knows, I am not a medical expert.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995282569\nI should at least give a little tip/warning that if any hero happens to get stunned, for them to recover it will take that hero's turn. Enemies get the same treatment as well. In other words, [b]Red Hook Studios[/b] took some inspiration from the original [b]Persona 3[/b] game and wanted to bring back memories.\n\nCertain moves will also only be available for you to use if that hero is in a certain spot in the party. If they happened to get moved or pushed back, they will be unable to use certain attacks or support abilities. It’s understandable for some attacks but for others it’s absolutely stupid - like, the [b]Vestal[/b] can’t use her [b]Divine Grace[/b] or [b]Divine Comfort[/b] abilities, which heal party members, if she is in the front. I understand that she is a support hero but it’s still pretty dumb that she can’t use those abilities if she happens to be pushed into the front.\n\nNow as much as [b]DD[/b] is fun, there are a few issues with the game that don’t hinder the experience but can be a turn-off for some people. Playing [b]DD[/b] can be a chore sometimes, you will have to do a lot of grinding depending on the difficulty that you choose. This is normal for an [b]RPG[/b] like this game but it can get very repetitive for some people. To add to the fact is that the game also relies on RNG for almost everything that happens in it. Trust me, when your hero misses an attack you will feel pain.\n\nSome of the DLCs in the game are also not recommended to be activated on your very first playthrough. Ones like the [b]Butcher’s Circus[/b] (which is online PvP) or the [b]Musketeer[/b] are fine because they just add features that don’t hinder the experience for the player. However, DLCs like the [b]Crimson Court[/b] add stuff like more grind, a very annoying status debuff, and is just punishing to new players. Buy the DLC on your first playthrough if you just want an even more painful experience.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]\nThe art style for [b]DD[/b] is absolutely beautiful, I love the gothic-based art style that the game has going for it, and is very detailed. I experienced no issues while I was playing the game.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995283203\nI tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. \n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nThere is a lot that I haven’t talked about with [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] as there are numerous things to uncover from the game. If you are someone who wants to play a very punishing game, then this is the right one for you and you will get your money’s worth because a playthrough could go up to at least 50+ hours.\n\n[quote] Women and men' soldiers and outlaws; fools and corpses.

I wouldn’t say it’s a roguelike, but it has permadeath once one of your heroes dies in combat is gone [spoiler] most likely [/spoiler] forever, this makes the game incredibly punishing.

The game makes an incredible emphasis on the positioning of your heroes some abilities are only available in specific rows so keeping the position of your heroes and messing up the enemies position it’s a key part of the gameplay. \nThis game highly rewards knowledge and using the right tool for each situation.

I've played it quite a few hours, which by itself might seem thumbs-up recommendation, but it really isn't.\n\nI like the battle line style games (by which I mean the array/position of your characters in a turn-based combat has meaning).  A front line, a back line, support, damage, looking for synergies.  Nifty. Engaging even.\nI've read/watched the guides and tips.  I didn't find any of it particularly of use, I've been playing these sorts of things for a while.\n\nThe reality of this game is... frustrating.  At anything higher than the easiest level, the RNG is cruel and punitive.  At the easiest level... some mild challenge (which ramped up _sharply_ for the final dungeon).  The designers should note there is a significant difference between challenging and just mean.  Not to mention a nuisance factor.  \nI'm okay with taking losses if it achieves my goals.  Slogging to earn enough money to make the characters viable so they can complete the only challenges available, watching them get crushed, oft with a series of crits from the enemies and misses on my part, in the first one or two meaningless fights in a run?  When there are likely to be 5 or 6 more fights plus maybe a boss?  Ugh.  The challenge is high enough that losing even one of four characters on the way to the boss is a death sentence (in the boss fight, that's fine, I've lost 3/4 and still won, dicey though).  \nHealing, especially stress healing, is sparse enough, and defenses low enough that one might think that the all damage is the way to go, but attrition will quickly show the error of that thinking.  And, ofc, the decent support classes mostly don't do enough damage &/or tank enough to make them viable on their own (as it should be, but there is a balance to be achieved in there somewhere).\n\nOh, and the money grind.  Painful, right up until you are flooded with it.  But did I mention the building upgrade resource grind?  Which is dependent on the RNG?  And your limited space, competing with money at every turn?  Choices matter and all that, but you truly need _everything_, right now, no exceptions, or you die trying.  Repeatedly.  Over and over.  Which might be okay... IF the losses at times didn't leave you so destitute as to be unable to continue at all.\nNot workable.\n\nAnd after now rage-quitting from yet another excruciating and drawn-out series of failures and TPWs (which is the usual way I go in this game, build, build, nurse the characters and teams, try to scrape by, then watch it all collapse like a house of cards), the game is uninstalled.",1690348731,1690348731,False,49,31,0.598903357982635498,0,True,False,False

Eventually, I decided to give the game a second chance because I wanted to at least beat it. I did a bit better and got a bit further, but honestly, after a while, the game started to feel like a bit of a chore. I felt like progress was slow and I was grinding a lot after a while. It seemed a bit repetitive and eventually I just felt like it wasn't worth it anymore. I couldn't force myself to get to the end because I just wasn't enjoying myself. I felt like I was just focused on farming trinkets/gold and leveling up the characters for most of the time I was playing rather than actually advancing.

For a slow-paced genre that relies on strategy to be fun, it can be hard to avoid situations where it's best to just use whatever move has the biggest numbers over and over. I feel this issue is best highlighted in pokemon, where casual players can get by pretty easily just by using a big move repeatedly and one-shotting everything. Darkest Dungeon completely circumvents all of the genre's usual flaws and forces you to think. It took me like 4 party-wipes to grasp that this game was something special, something that required a deep understanding of different synergies, combos, and mechanics, but once I started to put the pieces together, it became a blast. As of the writing of this review, my learning curve is only beginning to tread upward, but I can already say that DD has one of the best, if not the single best, turn-based RPG combat systems that I've ever seen. It doesn't need a grid map like fire emblem to introduce positioning elements. Even with its deceptively simple positioning system and the way it follows pokemon's formula of only allowing each character to know four moves at any given time, the synergies between different characters and the way their abilities compliment each other is truly a sight to behold. If you enjoy turn-based strategy, this game is a necessity. Plus, it's got workshop support, and it's one of those games with really cool devs who look at the awesome in-depth mods made by their community and make them into official content, or even publish them on the steam store as entirely new games in their own right like they did with Black Reliquary. As far as DLC goes, crimson court is basically more of the Darkest Dungeon you know and love. It has new mechanics, enemies, and some really cool bosses (I've only fought the crocodile so far, but the battle was very difficult in a very fun way, and beating it felt extremely rewarding), but it doesn't reinvent the wheel. The best part, however, is probably the Flagellant, a new class that damages and applies bleed to itself in exchange for healing other party members, doing big attacks, and otherwise helping the rest of the team. The Flagellant also has a few big moves that he can perform only at low HP, synergizing with his self-damage mechanic and making the class feel way more involved. The mission structure is much the same as ever. Color of madness and butcher's circus are a bit further removed from the base game, offering new game modes. Color of madness adds a new area, the farmstead, that acts like a sort of gauntlet mode. There's no torch, no food or camping, no corridors to traverse or objects to interact with. It's just back-to-back battles. Personally, I really enjoy the mode. It gives you constant action and simplifies the game a bit, tearing away some of the fluff and extra mechanics to give way to the game's phenomenal combat system. It also rewards you with unique trinkets to bring into normal missions, tying it nicely back into the main game's progression. Butcher's Circus, unlike the previous two DLCs, doesn't really contribute to the main game. It's a mode that's mostly independent of your estate's progression (you only need to unlock everything in this mode once, even if you complete your estate save file) which lets you partake in multiplayer battles. It doesn't really add to the base game in any way, but I don't care, because this mode fucking slaps. I absolutely love butcher's circus. It's a bit sandboxy, since you can customize your trinkets and heroes in any way you choose without risking the loss of those trinkets or heroes, which makes it a great proving ground to test a cool build. It's also just a ton of fun to put your strategies head to head against real people. The final paid DLC, the shieldbreaker class, doesn't add as much as the other two, but in my experience the shieldbreaker is busted as hell so I'd say it's worth it anyway. She's a dancer who plays a bit like the jester and has some nice hard-hitting attacks plus a little bit of bleed and blight. The other DLC hero, musketeer, is kinda mid, but she's also free so it doesn't matter.",1708242977,1708242977,True,6,0,0.591988146305084229,0,True,False,False

This was up to 2017 and the Butcher's Circus. Nowadays this is far from the case.\n\nThe original game with its two difficulties (normal and hard) and several old and newly added areas is very well balanced, challenging and rewarding for planning and experience.\n\nSince then the balance values have been tweaked making stress a more abundant problem, the PvP circus annoys the player every step of the week to play it in a giant glowing icon even though the servers are down for some players and Redhook never fixed this connectivity issue. Thus several achievements are impossible for a decent chunk of players.\n\nCombine that with two new mechanics, the blood curse and the farmstead. Both of these are optional and should be challenged mid to lategame. Ingame both tell the player to do it on Resolve 1-2. This is wrong. The Farmstead endless run will overwhelm early groups and will set stress and money back alot. Doing it on hardmode is akin to suicide as it saps precious resources for early build up.\n\nThe blood curse dungeon is a similar trap, spawning new ways to slow you down and to kill your people all over the map once it has been triggered. It should be avoided on hardmode runs if possible.\n\nThis game is not as well balanced as it was up to 2017, the game is not rewarding as it was up to 2017 and the game annoys you like nothing else with a feature that is DEAD. A dead feature that makes this game a nightmare for completionists. It is 100% incompleteable.\n\nIf you are a completionist, do not buy this game. If you dislike mobile game info terror... avoid it too. Although some mods remove that nuisance.\n\nNowadays this game is okay, play it and maybe complete the singleplayer content.

There are 2 issues:\n\nIssue #1: The language in the (updated) EULA that you need to Consent to monitoring while you play this. I understand that this is because of the Butcher's Circus (multiplayer) DLC, but it's not well defined, and was instituted after I bought the game, and that's not cool (I have never agreed to the updated EULA).\n\nIssue #2: This one's harder to understand unless you've played Darkest Dungeon already, because:\n--> The artwork is excellent.\n--> The narration is top-notch.\n--> The H.P. Lovecraft-inspired story line is dark & creepy & awesome.\n--> The mechanics are challenging (and I really like turn-based games), the heroes varied, and the build-up of your party is neat & interesting.\n\nAnd yet, I'm at the end of this game after many hours, and it simply... stops being fun to play. It screeches to a totally un-enjoyable halt. I actually have stopped caring if I finish Darkest Dungeon, and I'm not really interested in its sequel(s).\n\nIt's not that it's too difficult (you learn throughout the game that it is very punishing, and that's kind of the point - you still play *because* of this), but rather it eventually becomes a tedious grind for its own sake. I also understand completely that real life is absolutely like this; sometimes bad things just happen and all the best-laid plans get blown to pieces by some seemingly random event (and again, in a dark, hope-deprecating plot, this is one of the major points), but it doesn't make for a good gaming experience, or at least, one that I want. \n\nSo, in the end, a great deal of this equates to the game simply just wasting my time, which is something we all get less and less of.

Up against the 86 week time limit and with 8 heroes already dead, I wiped on the final boss of the very last dungeon and 86 weeks of game-playtime - many days of real time - went down the drain. It took me seven years to recover my morale enough to try again.\n\nYou start the game with two heroes, always the same two guys, Reynauld the kleptomaniac crusader and Dismas the cheating highwayman. In other games of this sort your heroes are always straight-backed courageous fellows who are in it to the end, but in this game your adventurers have quirks which are sometimes good, and sometimes bad (like being a kleptomaniac, or a known cheat). As they adventure through the dungeon they get stressed out and sometimes they'll crack and develop afflictions which cause them to behave strangely (and poorly) in combat. (Occasionally the stress will make them true heroes. But not very often.)\n\nIf they survive, they can perform stress relief activities like grabbing a drink, gambling at the bar, praying to their gods, other things of that nature, and recover enough to maybe go back and try again. New heroes will come to your Hamlet on the stage coach, ready to fight and die for you, and you will build parties of four and send them out every week to explore the dungeons, get gold and trinkets, level up, and upgrade their equipment at the Hamlet (which you also upgrade to get better heroes, better equipment, better skills, and better stress relief activities). Ultimately your final goal is to go into the Darkest Dungeon, four times, to stop the unspeakable horrors that dwell there from taking over your world.\n\nDeath of a hero is almost always permanent, and on Stygian difficulty if you lose 12 heroes the game is over, or if you take more than the 86 weeks the game gives you the game is over. (You can play on lower difficulties which have no time or death limits, if you want. That turns the game more into a rogue-lite than a rogue-like. That might be your cup of tea.)\n\nOn my latest playthrough, I triumphed against the final boss with 2 weeks to spare. It felt good. Really good. On the old road, I found redemption.\n\nExcellent game, stressful, but it is great fun to work your way through the combat puzzles, so to speak, and slowly get better and better at finding hero and skill combinations that let you tear through the inhabitants of the various dungeons. The dungeons ramp up in difficulty as your heroes level up, and they will refuse to go back to dungeons that are too easy for them, so you have to get better. The champion difficulty dungeons, for level 5-6 heroes, are very, very tough, especially the bosses. I tend to lose my heroes at the beginning, when they are level 0 nobodies, and at the end, when the highest level bosses expose the weaknesses in my old strategies.

Luck and randomness are parts of many games and can lead to unexpected and fun outcomes, but it can also lead to frustration. This game focuses heavily on gauging percent chances to hit, which can be a fun and strategic system; However, there is randomness that can lead to bullshit moments. Even though you have a 90% chance to land a hit, you miss three times in a row and low roll your corresponding heal, losing a hero as a result. Or, several enemies crit your hero at the start of a darkest dungeon run, killing the hero and requiring you to lose another hero on retreat.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, random quirk and disease distribution at the end of a dungeon can be brutal. It is frustrating when all of your heroes acquire a random disease, plus detrimental negative quirks, that you now have to spend money and time to remove. Negative quirks and diseases cannot be healed at the same time, and so you have to commit at least two days plus the gold cost.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the second issue of grinding. There is a significant amount of grinding required if you want the best chance of beating the game, or if you lose high level heroes. This is especially true with the crimson court DLC. This grind is often fun due to the enjoyability of the core gameplay loop, but tedious at other times (such as attempting to get invites to the crimson court, grinding gold, or raising a hero back up after losing one).\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nAlthough the game is not perfect and randomness can be infuriating, Darkest Dungeon is worth playing for its fantastic gameplay loop and incredible atmosphere.",1709484980,1709484980,True,32,0,0.764380455017089844,0,False,False,False

The gimmick of the game is that you cannot prepare for everything (unless inordinate quirk locking be considered a virtue), the trinkets always have some kind of downside (or kind of useless when they don't), but the good thing is that having stuns, lots of damage, speed, accuracy, some healing and some stress healing and camp skills to heal stress makes the game a lot more managable, so the conclusion is that you want to look out for heroes that have the aforementioned things and don't interfere with each other's positioning and always can do something useful in case you get surprised or shuffled. Another factor is more related to your personal blunders like forgetting some provisions like Blood or shovels and what not, or starting a fight you can't finish (Shambler, Collector) or having to abandon the mission because your team comp couldn't get to the boss room with little damage, or letting a hero get an affliction (this usually causes a domino effect and you'll probably abandon the quest soon).\nOnce you harness the game mechanics and RNG to some extent, the game becomes really enjoyable. The only feasible downsides are probably grinding level 6 heroes and RNG screwing you over on a rare occasion (like your level 6 Flagellant  with 87% deathblow resist dying on the first death's door check, have fun spending an hour or two grinding a new hero with good quirks!

Not today[/h1]\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\n[b]Darkest Dungeon (DD)[/b] is a unique game, as I never played a game as punishing as this one. With the sequel recently being released, my interest was piqued to try out the first game that I happened to already own but never spent much time playing, and I'm glad that I took the opportunity to check out this gothic-themed experience.\n\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Interesting gothic based story\n[*]Fun but brutal gameplay that is very punishing\n[*]Upgrades for your heroes, town, and more\n[*]Beautiful 2D gothic art style\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Playing this game can be a chore at times due to the needed grind\n[*]There are times when you will be reliant on RNG and it might screw you over\n[*]Activating some of the DLCs on your first playthrough is not recommended\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story starts out with a man known as the [b]Ancestor[/b]; he learns of this special power that is somewhere deep in his mansion. He then uses up his family’s remaining fortune to hire people to help him dig up this mysterious power. However, it turns out that this power was something worldly and he ran from the dungeon. Only the [b]ancestry[/b] survived and he wrote a letter to the next heir of the family, to fix the mistake he made. After he sealed the letter and before the angry mob of villagers that were mad for what he did could get him, the [b]Ancestor[/b] had ended his life.\n\nThe story for [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is not fully told to you directly, rather, it’s told to you at different points in the game, mainly before you do boss missions. It’s interesting at the very least and I like the gothic [b]Cthulhu mythos[/b] theme it has going for it. Although [b]DD[/b] takes inspiration from the [b]Lovecraftian[/b] universe, there are also different inspirations that are included as well. The heroes you hire also have back stories to them as well.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay for [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is fun but also very challenging and at the same time, it can be very difficult to grasp. There are many mechanics that you yourself have to try and get used to. You will be able to hire different heroes that each have different abilities for them to use. Each of them also may have a different mechanic that corresponds to them, however, they all do share the stress feature. Stress in the game is determined by what the hero goes through in a given situation. When stress reaches 100, that hero will have a certain negative Affliction inflicted on them, like them being fearful, paranoid, etc. \n\nHowever, there is a chance that some heroes will be given a virtue when they reach 100 stress, they get increased stats and will randomly heal themselves. So, while most heroes get afflictions and break, others will use their stressful moments as something to encourage themselves. If a hero gets to 200 stress, they will lose the virtue and go back to zero stress, while those with afflictions suffer a heart attack.\n\nDuring combat, your heroes can do certain attacks or abilities to buff/debuff allies or enemies. Each hero has a certain amount of health and it does vary, when their health runs out they will be put under a [b]Death’s Door[/b] status. When they are in this state, they will suffer state penalties and they have to go through a test to see if they will survive the next attack. I should note that if your hero is at 1 health and the enemies attack them with a move that does a lot of damage, they will tank the entire attack except the one damage. The only way for a hero to die is by failing the [b]Death’s Door[/b] test.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995283070\nIf a hero suffers a heart attack while at [b]Death’s Door[/b], they will be killed immediately, when a hero dies, they are lost for good and will also lose the equipped charms they have. You can recover them if you lose a hero in battle but if it’s outside of one, they are gone completely. So pray that your best heroes survive the attacks and that their stress does not get too high.\n\nThere are ways to relieve stress, like taking out enemies or using a camping ability at a campsite. If your heroes survive the mission, you sent them on, you can send them to a few stress-reducing activities like making them meditate, drink at the bar, gamble, pray, etc. There are also times when a hero will get a disease, so you must take them to the [b]Sanitarium[/b] for them to get cured. A hero can get a max of three diseases, if they happen to get another one, it will just replace one of the current diseases they have. Last I checked diseases don’t necessarily work like that but who knows, I am not a medical expert.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995282569\nI should at least give a little tip/warning that if any hero happens to get stunned, for them to recover it will take that hero's turn. Enemies get the same treatment as well. In other words, [b]Red Hook Studios[/b] took some inspiration from the original [b]Persona 3[/b] game and wanted to bring back memories.\n\nCertain moves will also only be available for you to use if that hero is in a certain spot in the party. If they happened to get moved or pushed back, they will be unable to use certain attacks or support abilities. It’s understandable for some attacks but for others it’s absolutely stupid - like, the [b]Vestal[/b] can’t use her [b]Divine Grace[/b] or [b]Divine Comfort[/b] abilities, which heal party members, if she is in the front. I understand that she is a support hero but it’s still pretty dumb that she can’t use those abilities if she happens to be pushed into the front.\n\nNow as much as [b]DD[/b] is fun, there are a few issues with the game that don’t hinder the experience but can be a turn-off for some people. Playing [b]DD[/b] can be a chore sometimes, you will have to do a lot of grinding depending on the difficulty that you choose. This is normal for an [b]RPG[/b] like this game but it can get very repetitive for some people. To add to the fact is that the game also relies on RNG for almost everything that happens in it. Trust me, when your hero misses an attack you will feel pain.\n\nSome of the DLCs in the game are also not recommended to be activated on your very first playthrough. Ones like the [b]Butcher’s Circus[/b] (which is online PvP) or the [b]Musketeer[/b] are fine because they just add features that don’t hinder the experience for the player. However, DLCs like the [b]Crimson Court[/b] add stuff like more grind, a very annoying status debuff, and is just punishing to new players. Buy the DLC on your first playthrough if you just want an even more painful experience.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]\nThe art style for [b]DD[/b] is absolutely beautiful, I love the gothic-based art style that the game has going for it, and is very detailed. I experienced no issues while I was playing the game.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995283203\nI tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. \n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nThere is a lot that I haven’t talked about with [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] as there are numerous things to uncover from the game. If you are someone who wants to play a very punishing game, then this is the right one for you and you will get your money’s worth because a playthrough could go up to at least 50+ hours.\n\n[quote] Women and men' soldiers and outlaws; fools and corpses.

I wouldn’t say it’s a roguelike, but it has permadeath once one of your heroes dies in combat is gone [spoiler] most likely [/spoiler] forever, this makes the game incredibly punishing.

The game makes an incredible emphasis on the positioning of your heroes some abilities are only available in specific rows so keeping the position of your heroes and messing up the enemies position it’s a key part of the gameplay. \nThis game highly rewards knowledge and using the right tool for each situation.

I've played it quite a few hours, which by itself might seem thumbs-up recommendation, but it really isn't.\n\nI like the battle line style games (by which I mean the array/position of your characters in a turn-based combat has meaning).  A front line, a back line, support, damage, looking for synergies.  Nifty. Engaging even.\nI've read/watched the guides and tips.  I didn't find any of it particularly of use, I've been playing these sorts of things for a while.\n\nThe reality of this game is... frustrating.  At anything higher than the easiest level, the RNG is cruel and punitive.  At the easiest level... some mild challenge (which ramped up _sharply_ for the final dungeon).  The designers should note there is a significant difference between challenging and just mean.  Not to mention a nuisance factor.  \nI'm okay with taking losses if it achieves my goals.  Slogging to earn enough money to make the characters viable so they can complete the only challenges available, watching them get crushed, oft with a series of crits from the enemies and misses on my part, in the first one or two meaningless fights in a run?  When there are likely to be 5 or 6 more fights plus maybe a boss?  Ugh.  The challenge is high enough that losing even one of four characters on the way to the boss is a death sentence (in the boss fight, that's fine, I've lost 3/4 and still won, dicey though).  \nHealing, especially stress healing, is sparse enough, and defenses low enough that one might think that the all damage is the way to go, but attrition will quickly show the error of that thinking.  And, ofc, the decent support classes mostly don't do enough damage &/or tank enough to make them viable on their own (as it should be, but there is a balance to be achieved in there somewhere).\n\nOh, and the money grind.  Painful, right up until you are flooded with it.  But did I mention the building upgrade resource grind?  Which is dependent on the RNG?  And your limited space, competing with money at every turn?  Choices matter and all that, but you truly need _everything_, right now, no exceptions, or you die trying.  Repeatedly.  Over and over.  Which might be okay... IF the losses at times didn't leave you so destitute as to be unable to continue at all.\nNot workable.\n\nAnd after now rage-quitting from yet another excruciating and drawn-out series of failures and TPWs (which is the usual way I go in this game, build, build, nurse the characters and teams, try to scrape by, then watch it all collapse like a house of cards), the game is uninstalled.",1690348731,1690348731,False,49,31,0.598903357982635498,0,True,False,False

Eventually, I decided to give the game a second chance because I wanted to at least beat it. I did a bit better and got a bit further, but honestly, after a while, the game started to feel like a bit of a chore. I felt like progress was slow and I was grinding a lot after a while. It seemed a bit repetitive and eventually I just felt like it wasn't worth it anymore. I couldn't force myself to get to the end because I just wasn't enjoying myself. I felt like I was just focused on farming trinkets/gold and leveling up the characters for most of the time I was playing rather than actually advancing.

For a slow-paced genre that relies on strategy to be fun, it can be hard to avoid situations where it's best to just use whatever move has the biggest numbers over and over. I feel this issue is best highlighted in pokemon, where casual players can get by pretty easily just by using a big move repeatedly and one-shotting everything. Darkest Dungeon completely circumvents all of the genre's usual flaws and forces you to think. It took me like 4 party-wipes to grasp that this game was something special, something that required a deep understanding of different synergies, combos, and mechanics, but once I started to put the pieces together, it became a blast. As of the writing of this review, my learning curve is only beginning to tread upward, but I can already say that DD has one of the best, if not the single best, turn-based RPG combat systems that I've ever seen. It doesn't need a grid map like fire emblem to introduce positioning elements. Even with its deceptively simple positioning system and the way it follows pokemon's formula of only allowing each character to know four moves at any given time, the synergies between different characters and the way their abilities compliment each other is truly a sight to behold. If you enjoy turn-based strategy, this game is a necessity. Plus, it's got workshop support, and it's one of those games with really cool devs who look at the awesome in-depth mods made by their community and make them into official content, or even publish them on the steam store as entirely new games in their own right like they did with Black Reliquary. As far as DLC goes, crimson court is basically more of the Darkest Dungeon you know and love. It has new mechanics, enemies, and some really cool bosses (I've only fought the crocodile so far, but the battle was very difficult in a very fun way, and beating it felt extremely rewarding), but it doesn't reinvent the wheel. The best part, however, is probably the Flagellant, a new class that damages and applies bleed to itself in exchange for healing other party members, doing big attacks, and otherwise helping the rest of the team. The Flagellant also has a few big moves that he can perform only at low HP, synergizing with his self-damage mechanic and making the class feel way more involved. The mission structure is much the same as ever. Color of madness and butcher's circus are a bit further removed from the base game, offering new game modes. Color of madness adds a new area, the farmstead, that acts like a sort of gauntlet mode. There's no torch, no food or camping, no corridors to traverse or objects to interact with. It's just back-to-back battles. Personally, I really enjoy the mode. It gives you constant action and simplifies the game a bit, tearing away some of the fluff and extra mechanics to give way to the game's phenomenal combat system. It also rewards you with unique trinkets to bring into normal missions, tying it nicely back into the main game's progression. Butcher's Circus, unlike the previous two DLCs, doesn't really contribute to the main game. It's a mode that's mostly independent of your estate's progression (you only need to unlock everything in this mode once, even if you complete your estate save file) which lets you partake in multiplayer battles. It doesn't really add to the base game in any way, but I don't care, because this mode fucking slaps. I absolutely love butcher's circus. It's a bit sandboxy, since you can customize your trinkets and heroes in any way you choose without risking the loss of those trinkets or heroes, which makes it a great proving ground to test a cool build. It's also just a ton of fun to put your strategies head to head against real people. The final paid DLC, the shieldbreaker class, doesn't add as much as the other two, but in my experience the shieldbreaker is busted as hell so I'd say it's worth it anyway. She's a dancer who plays a bit like the jester and has some nice hard-hitting attacks plus a little bit of bleed and blight. The other DLC hero, musketeer, is kinda mid, but she's also free so it doesn't matter.",1708242977,1708242977,True,6,0,0.591988146305084229,0,True,False,False

This was up to 2017 and the Butcher's Circus. Nowadays this is far from the case.\n\nThe original game with its two difficulties (normal and hard) and several old and newly added areas is very well balanced, challenging and rewarding for planning and experience.\n\nSince then the balance values have been tweaked making stress a more abundant problem, the PvP circus annoys the player every step of the week to play it in a giant glowing icon even though the servers are down for some players and Redhook never fixed this connectivity issue. Thus several achievements are impossible for a decent chunk of players.\n\nCombine that with two new mechanics, the blood curse and the farmstead. Both of these are optional and should be challenged mid to lategame. Ingame both tell the player to do it on Resolve 1-2. This is wrong. The Farmstead endless run will overwhelm early groups and will set stress and money back alot. Doing it on hardmode is akin to suicide as it saps precious resources for early build up.\n\nThe blood curse dungeon is a similar trap, spawning new ways to slow you down and to kill your people all over the map once it has been triggered. It should be avoided on hardmode runs if possible.\n\nThis game is not as well balanced as it was up to 2017, the game is not rewarding as it was up to 2017 and the game annoys you like nothing else with a feature that is DEAD. A dead feature that makes this game a nightmare for completionists. It is 100% incompleteable.\n\nIf you are a completionist, do not buy this game. If you dislike mobile game info terror... avoid it too. Although some mods remove that nuisance.\n\nNowadays this game is okay, play it and maybe complete the singleplayer content.
