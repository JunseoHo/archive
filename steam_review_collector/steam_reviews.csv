chase classic to anyone (not even high spenders and whales):\n\n[list]\n [*] this game is incredibly predatory. this is by far the worst monetization system i have ever seen in any games that i've played. so much in fact that it completely divides the population between free-to-play and whales there is very little room in between those 2 extremes for low spenders.\n [*] the rune system is very lacking and needs an overhaul. there is no targetted loot and you are completely at mercy of rng. unlike the prop system for armor what you get is what you have forever.\n [*] there is no deterministic way to get better gear. the randomizer scrolls are very low drop rate you have a very limited number of attempts to get them per day. there is only 1 scroll that can deterministically change the second best gear set in the game (berkas scroll) but you can only get those one on the final level of the paid season pass. yes you can only get 1 of those every 3 months if you pay $20 for the chaser pass. 1 property in 1 of 12 gear pieces in 1 of 22 characters in the game.\n [*] on top of there being no way deterministic way to get gear upgrades the reinforcement system will actively and aggressively attempt to make you weaker by resetting or destroying completely your high level stones. this essentially forces players to never engage with that system unless they acquire reinforcement protection scrolls. you can't just go and try your luck and spend some gp to attempt an upgrade because the chance of an upgrade to +17 is 4% while the chance of reducing a level is 46% destroying the stone is 31% and resetting the stone to +0 is 10%. the odds are even worse for +18.\n [*] all free pets are very costly to craft and barely effective to use to the point that it's a waste of time and energy to grind the materials for crafting any of them.\n [*] there is no direction in what to do if after you complete the leveling campaign. if you don't ask for advice in the official discord server (which is very good and full of helpful people) you are most likely going to keep trying to play another world missions and get repeatedly kicked for being undergeared.\n [*] the endgame is very fun (200k+ total attack) but getting there is very miserable. you are playing crucible sanctum and wizard lab for a minimum of 72 each to craft all 12 gear slots assuming you are optimal and don't waste time on recrafts. you can only do 1 run of each per day per character so you need to either spend 72 days playing a single character or get multiple characters to max level to use them to also play those missions to get the gear faster.\n [*] the leveling campaing is very unbalanced and unfun to rerun. the difficulty spikes a lot when you reach xenia and just keeps getting worse and worse after that. this feels like the leftovers of the initial design of when these dungeons were meant to be challenging and to be the end game but they are currently just a nuisance which makes a lot of players just wait for a full lobby so they can heal while others fight in order to beat all encounters or worse: not bother to level more characters at all.\n [*] the game encourages you to build wide and level multiple characters in order to be able to play the timegated missions to get good gear for your main characters but it really feels like a chore to change from a 300k+ character to a 80k character only to get stuff to use on your main character again. if you like to just play one character and be done with it the game will heavily punish you for choosing to play that way. you can circumvent this to some extent by spending a lot of money on gacha but that still won't be enough because you can't circumvent the timegating for gear and upgrades. the game also doesn't allow you to use your strongest characters to grind for gear for your lower characters because of the timegating.\n [*] the communication from kog to players is... really lacking. you only know what is going to happen in the day before a major patch every 3 weeks. there is no public roadmap of what it's to come there is never a reason to be excited about the future of the game. the feedback forum in the discord server is essentially abandoned with barely no presence of gms telling what feedback was relayed what is being worked on and what feedback was denied and won't be implemented. the ticketing system also gets essentially no feedback after the first few email exchanges they just tell you to watch the patch notes in case your reported bug gets fixed.\n [*] the fomo is also insane. you can never know what is the current rotation of gacha and what is coming next. we are talking about the system that is used by the whales no one knows what will be coming to the game and when sets are being rerun again which usually takes 4 to 6 months after their last appearance.\n [*] the game is very unrewarding and unfullfilling to play. you can log in multiple days in a week and make absolutely no progress toward getting stronger. incremental upgrades are very far and few in between and the experience will get tiresome and feel like a chore rather quickly.\n [*] anything that isn't gamebreaking takes months if not a whole year to get fixed when it ever does. i'm a developer as well (but not for games) and i understand how the development/iteration/testing/deployment cycles works but there is no justification for small bugs (like localization) to take 6 to 18 months to get fixed it's just insane and make players stop caring about reporting bugs at all. they are probably going to have churned way before that.\n [*] a lot of items that should be common to all chars are actually inventory items so you are forced to play a lot of inventory management in order to share darkstones hero bullions cores chase coordi fragments monster cards tickets and a dozen of other things. it's zero fun to be moving around all of those things just be ready to play the game.\n [*] the censorship in text chat is very poorly implemented and makes any sort of communication essentially futile. you need to use some other platform for talking to people. the official discord server is also affected by this problem to an even greater extent since your entire messages get deleted and you can actually get muted for hours if you trip over the invisible word block list.\n[/list]\n\nessentially all of the economies in the game are busted.\n[list]\n [*] you barely get any gp on the end game.\n [*] vp costs are all over the place. one scroll to reroll all properties (gp reset) for one piece of gear costs 900 vp but a scroll to reroll one of the 3-5 properties (single property scroll) costs 8500 vp (yes nearly 10x the price). neither of these guarantee you to get what you need either.\n [*] essentially all gear in the points shop are impossible to buy without saving an entire month for one item.\n [*] there is no way to effectively grind for darkstones to upgrade your runes.\nthe gacha economy is completely insane. gacha offers the best coordi you can get with the best stats in the game but there is no way to earn scrolls to get those coordi pieces. it takes an average of 400 to 800 scrolls to get a full set for one character and that will cost between 120k and 240k vp which is $100 to $200 for one character. this game has 22 characters.\n [*] your power increase is timegated essentially in everything and not just for a while it's for a long time.\n[/list]",2024-03-01,2024-03-01,False,48,1,0.813767313957214355,0,False,False,False

from 2009-2015 religiously and is now just getting back into it for about 2 weeks. it still hasn't changed i love the game and since the original server shut down i've just been itching to play it again and no other game has successfully scratched that itch.\n\n17 days of playing and i already have 5 level 85 characters 3 of them are 100k ta (total attack which is basically your characters power level) and 1 220k ta. my other characters are also already on their 3rd/4th job quests which says a lot. yes i have again played this game religiously like i did way back. they made a lot of changes sure. some i'd say great and some i dislike. but in the end it still basically is the same game aside from the bugs and disconnection issues.\n\nbut why? why am i not recommending this game? i just said that i love the game so much and showed proof by already racking up the hours in a small amount of time. am i crazy? am i trolling? the answer is simple - the way they manage the game. i will list them down here to summarize the issues i noticed that is plaguing the game.\n\n- updates. as a few week old player i haven't really encountered any major update until yesterday. there is a new dungeon called dimensional chaser. for those unfamiliar that is the name of the phone game they released way back in july 2018 internationally which i have supported for maybe a year since its release. that being said you expect it to have new stuff for you. a new challenge and maybe new enemies. but no. everything is recycled. the stages the enemies the boss. they are all from other parts in the game that already exists like kricktria and tod. it feels like you are just running the same dungeon. the enemies are all trash even in hard mode. everything dies so fast and it just feels like you're doing the literal same dungeon you were doing daily but with only 3 stages with only 1 wave of enemy each. remember this is coming from a 200k ta player and playing a dungeon like that will definitely not be fun for end game players and definitely not enough for new players.\n\n- bugs/crashes. as a very old game that did not receive any major graphic updates or updates in general since the old days you would expect the game to be very stable. no. getting disconnected every other minute fps drops lags connectivity issues with other players. again with the developers being lazy and just copy pasting stuff and calling it new content and especially with the low gpu/cpu requirement of the game you would assume that this game would be stable with no crashes no lags and think that the developers should at least have a lot more time checking bugs and errors in the game and making sure that the game they are releasing is stable as they are apparently not putting in any effort at all in making new contents. but no. in my small time of playing i honestly think that they just resuscitated the game as a cash grab for nostalgia. sure they made updates sure they made some balancing stuff but with the state of the game no matter how delusional or in love you might be with the game you cannot help but notice all these flaws as you play. i'm not looking for a perfect game and by no means am i looking for a game that will be f2p friendly. it's just that all these issues something you can't really ignore and affects game-play as it happens all too frequently. the game is grindy enough we don't need more issues to take up more time.\n\n- gameplay. now as an old player this isn't really much of an issue but for new players of the game they might get turned off by this rinse and repeat grinding. ok dungeons are way easier now characters are free now and you don't need to quest to unlock them anymore job change quests are very easy too which if you are an old player you would know that you will spend ages in outer wall of serdin getting those orc medals which maybe drops about 2-4 per run then finally killing the orc boss for 3/5 medallions which probably wont drop even once after 5 runs. but. even after all this you are kind of required to level up all the 21 characters to 85 or at least unlock all their 4th jobs for account wide stat bonuses to add to your ta and not everyone has the time/energy to do that much repetitive grinding. not to mention for end game you just do 3-4 dungeons once a day on all your characters and transfer the loot through storage to the character you are building to be able to craft that equipment set to get those stats. i like it though as you can control how much time you will need to spend per day but i don't see a lot of new players being attracted to that kind of grind fest with literally no sense and direction at all since all contents can be cleared with just 300-400k. reaching 500k+ just makes it faster.\n\n- pvp. this is also a gameplay issue. the pvp in this game is literally dead. with the balancing updates they made on the game most players just decided to abandon ship. it made it less enjoyable honestly. the best time for pvp was way back 2010-2011 where the game still does not care about stats and just skill. i remember being a level 8 elesis or a level 16 jin and beating those level 50-60+ players (it is super hard to level before) which says a lot since when the game was updated with stats you won't even do a dent or a scratch to those players anymore. classic changed that by balancing stats so you and your enemy both have the same stats but them limiting what your character can do by adding tons of cds on skills make it seem like they just enabled noobs/casual gameplay more than tryhards which actually are the ones grinding pvp. sure it was unbalanced before. sure there were lots of spammable moves before. but we adapt we improvise and we overcome. that is the beauty of pvp. you find ways to win. and they killed that very aspect.\n\n- roadmap. the game has no direction. at least that we know of. there is no roadmap no update no datamining no player-developer relationship. nothing. basically you will know that there is an update probably a week before they release an update and that's it. we have no way of knowing what the game plans to do what it wants to do what its direction is in at least even half a years time what its goals are and most importantly if it will stay. we just have no way of knowing. they might just shut down suddenly like they did 9 years ago who knows. we just don't have that security and they don't give a fk. that's one of the reasons players will hold off from spending even if you want to support the game even just a little bit.\n\nthe p2w in this game doesn't really matter anymore and isn't that much big of a deal anyway since they give out free premium currency per character you level up to max which can be enough to probably not min-max your main character but equip it with gacha sets. but honestly with rng it will never be enough. but with pvp dead it does not matter. in my opinion it is better now since they can just carry you in dungeons by 1 tapping stuff and its just make your dailies a whole lot faster. \n\nall in all i love the game but again i do not recommend it. unless the developers step up and really show that they care and love this game as much as we do or ideally more than us i will never be able to recommend it to others. i am just in too deep and it is ingrained so much into my childhood and adolescent years that i will just continue to play it no matter what happens until it closes down again. i'm not spending though unlike other games i played. they have not yet gained my trust back and they are not showing any signs that they care about the player base.",2023-12-30,2024-01-11,False,59,4,0.771297752857208252,0,False,False,False

but yeah all the other characters just seemed to be forgettable as well. genshin impact and arknights have way more characters than they have but they still managed to make them look quirky remarkable and useful even when it's niche.\n9. can we just make up your mind and just have to do the same dungeon just once instead of twice? that's only to finish a quest where you need a certain rating back attack not taking hits. they could have just assign the quest in pretty much any dungeon that's within certain level range.\n10. lag issue. i don't know if they have done anything to fix it or if they could do something about this. but it's a deal breaker to me that i have to play with players from other half of the globe only to have connectivity issue. but i don't have anyone else to play it with??? t_t\n11. last but not the least with all the things in my list taken into consideration no wonder why everything still feels grindy despite they pretty much trimmed down the requirements for next jobs. frankly it's not just about the amount of things you need to do but how convenient it is for you to do them.\n\nas it stands right now i may give this game further a try but i don't think i'll last long. i think that it was a mistake that they revived this game in the first place. i appreciate that they tried to change it a little but they should have considered that the people who used to play this game so lovingly are now adults who had to balance living their lives and having a time for our personal interests including games. i'm no longer that teen who used to play this game to no sleep.\n\nso yes i'm speaking this with a heavy heart that this game just doesn't hit me the way it used to before. instead of reviving this old game they could have revive this game differently back from scratch and improve the core gameplay assets and optimizations. maybe they can take up ideas from how new companies in the industry does their games. they could have taken a different path like make grand chase both playable for pc and mobile too.\n\nokay i may be praising gi and other gacha game a bit too much but can imagine that gc can take this path instead: \n- have a sidescroll openworld to do some of the grindy quests (i think elsword have this)\n- trim the equipment into few simple pieces. if they wanna extend the stat just go all out with sockets and gear upgrading this will help lessen the amount of gears in your inventory.\n- make costume in different colors (elsword have this too) i'm sure even arme will get tired of purple eventually.\n- instead of gear set gacha make character gacha. so they can go ham with characters. just make sure to add some interesting lore and well thought skills.\n- just make gacha gear purchase-able instead. i mean having to pull for one character in any gacha game is already pain what more with pulling an entire gear set piece by piece?\n\nanyway that's enough from my long list of thoughts about the game.",2023-01-06,2023-01-06,False,36,2,0.677483260631561279,1,False,False,False

the world map the shop the stages and the low movement set of the enemies are exactly as they were in the first season of the game.\nso yeah i don't have any problem with not having all the characters in the games 'cause i understand they are adding them one by one and eventually everyone will end up showing up. i suppose they do it to make us say hey look kog games updates the game on a recurring basis that's good they don't have it abandoned but they really shouldn't have thought that they could apply that tactic with the items in the store or the gameplay itself.\nbecause everything is fine right?

because the gp store lacks the essential equipment items of weapons and armor. if not by spending real money or wasting vp the only way to get weapons and armor is by praying that monsters drop the equipment of the character you are using or at least the equipment of the ones that are currently playable because yes you can earn items for characters that aren't yet in the game which represents a problem because those items only take up space. if they were only for characters that are already available you can at least choose to give them a use.\nhowever i know you can acquire equipment by completing missions but you pretty much get the entire level 20 set when you reach level 25 and you are already in need of higher level armor and damage so it would be nice if they prioritize bringing back the items from the gp store.\nnow that was the problem with the store putting it aside i'll talk very vaguely about the problem in the gameplay because i am not going to make a list with all the maps and enemies that are missing things and i don't even have to explain why the interface of season 5 outside of the quests was better than the one we have from season 1. \ni can say that there are quests that had more areas that could be visited before the original game died and i think it wouldn't have cost them anything to have used the updated versions of each map. like seriously they would even have saved the tedious task of then having to replace outdated maps in future patches.\nthen about the enemies i will give as an example the most notable of all which is drake worm. drake worm had an attack in which he lunged forward and ended up positioning himself on the other side of the screen. i replayed his quest so many times now and he never did that attack that i remember so well and just like him there are several enemies who never use his alternate attack moves that i know exist. this has no explanation literally has no explanation.\n\nso do i recommend grandchase classic? no.\n\nbecause of how the game is now i do not recommend it at all.\nit is impressive how in the first three days they had to create new servers because they were all saturated and now there is only one server busy of the almost 20 there are. the problem is not that there aren't people who want to play the problem is that people want to play grandchase in conditions. the original grandchase wasn't a masterpiece in fact it was a bit far from being precisely a game in condition but this was a perfect time to be able to turn it into one and kog games messed it up again.\nalthough to make it an enjoyable game i just need to see it as it was at the end of season 5 i think they could have been even more attentive and tried to improve some things slightly after all it is supposed that if they relaunched the old version of grandchase it was to get a smile from the fans.\ni'm not asking for an otherworldly graphic upgrade really but improve the scenarios just a bit and only the scenarios not the characters. also maybe fixing the problems that certain attacks pass through enemies without damaging them  and other things like that. i can assure that no one is going to die from working on these small details since 90% of the game is done. having saidthat i guess my review ends here.\n\nnow the next thing i'm going to say is not so much in the review anymore but i want to say this anyway:\ni think grandchase has a much larger fan base than kog thinks it has and to which it should pay more attention. really if they say that they are going to do like valkyrie connect and upload to steam grandchase dimensional chaser surely they would have many more active users in that game and it wouldn't be a surprise the original game was born on pc why release the continuation exclusively for android? it just doesn't make sense. dear kog i hate you for that.\n\nthanks for reading.",2021-11-15,2021-11-15,False,1,0,0.479942679405212402,0,False,False,False

tell me that anyone wants the gp item over hell spear the premium only effect that sends spears out of the sky at an unknowable rate dealing some damage. how this compares to attack and other stats and how you should weigh it you are given no guidance. every item shows attack up or down but its never accurate. its incomprehensible. you cant even share gems the most common item in the game using the premium warehouse. \n\nno big deal though right? you can play and get the same stuff as everyone else you just need to work a little harder for it that's not play to win is it? a few pets (which were nerfed out of any appeal altogether) cosmetics and time savers are a big deal right? \n\nits really difficult for me to say that's true. a few years ago things were much different i will give the developers that work has gone into this but the publishers influence versus the developers work is clear as day. you used to have a free to play shop where you could buy upgrade materials accessories weapons armor pets you name it. premium players had access to a few of the more op pets and for like 100$ instead of running the hardest dungeon in the game 200x for thanny boy. pretty steep. \n\nthe free to play shop is gone now. you can no longer buy armor cloaks weapons accessories pets costumes upgrade materials exp boosts. well kog knew people would say this so they made it just enough that the above isnt technically true. you can buy level 10 and below accessories for a few slots using points which isnt the same as gp and required signing on. its 8000 points for one day exp boost. you can only earn 500 points per day.... \n\nthe in game courtesy now is required for all improvements to weapons meaning you guessed it- even if you buy the premium weapons upgrade materials level reducer exp boost the best potions bundle protection scrolls odds are your items will still break and you will hit one of two frustrating bottlenecks. \n\n1) you outlevel your good equipment and use your good materials on it and you jump to level 80. now you have no good armor for your level and you will be blocked from  raid lobbys for not being ss (not players will not let you the game actually only permits the highest rating which is only available to cash players).\n\n2) you dont even get to rest having spent 100$ on a  gacha game and heaven knows how much making perfect gear. your equipment isnt really good enough as it stands either way the mobs are too tanky and hit way too hard. \n\ni could go on for hours about the plainly greedy behaviour from the publisher how they are not managing to stop any meaningful amount of hackers banning legitimate players just for interacting with a hacker is a problem i have heard of from several folks. rehasing decade old content. no reward at all for returning players. nostalgic for few but the majority of players that spend a meaningful amount of time trying to progress will not like what is on offer as it currently stands that is certain. already there are seemingly 1000's of guilds named random characters that are totally empty or inactive. theres no public chat because the bot farmers are so bad (how is this even an issue in a 2d fighting game is beyond me). \n\nkog is not even trying to save grand chase. they made the games legacy worse. they didnt put the cart in front of the horse stop giving them benefit of the doubt. if you say its not pay to win maybe your right its more like they're selling tickets to skip the line to get to the popcorn line to listen to a decade old recording of a dead korean horse being beaten and tell you that your riding an elephant. insulting. weird. dark assassin gave me carpel tunnel in both of my wrists. armor drops for characters that have 12 characters to release before them instead of armor for the toon you are playing. \n\nif you are just now hearing about it dont. if you have heard of it get in here and vomit on these review boards and type #longlivethechase until they put something out that took some actual creativity and treats players decently instead of like vat grown vegetables.",2021-09-28,2021-09-28,False,1,0,0,0,False,False,False

this.\njust play gc history instead. made by people who understand the game active community reverted a ton of problems with the official version like shared inventory shared pets proper character rebalance and even added a ton of new custom content dungeons and dx11 support.\nthis release is guaranteed to die as soon as the last character re-release stops milking the gacha whales and it suffers from peak why would i fix the problem when i can sell the solution to a problem i made?.\n\n[b]pros of gc classic:[/b]\n+ it's mostly the game as it died so it works for nostalgia.\n+ increased difficulty mostly due to enemies doing more damage which is mainly a good thing for veterans that want a challenge.\n+ all your characters get extra stats and small rewards incentives for leveling more characters. +30% back attack damage is pretty good for getting 4th class with 2 characters. and by good i mean almost mandatory due to endgame damage sponges.\n+ some free cash currency for leveling each character probably to get you enticed into buying other stuff.\n\n[b]cons of gc classic:[/b]\n- it's mostly the game as it died: per character inventory per character pets per character titles per character gc club subscription.\n- increased difficulty mostly due to enemies doing more damage and taking way more damage. at the labyrinth it's pretty common to see bosses doing 30%~60% of your max hp and if you get stunlocked that's death unless you break on time on a run that often takes 10~20 minutes and potions are not cheap. in some cases enemies will often spam the same move over and over making it almost impossible to approach and start an attack->skill->attack chain and even if you can you're going to need a decent pet to have enough mp to keep going.\n- some bosses don't feel like they actually got balanced at all. dealing with the double perseo fight for the first time in the labyrinth took us 80 minutes due to how stupidly insane his hp pool was and how much it can heal from 1 orb touching someone. the 3 hera heads in the labyrinth would also require an insane amount of potion spamming and ronan defense buffs to deal with the constant full stage dots. then other stages like sethek and aranya completely break and spam their most op full stage move back to back if you touch them with ronan's fire dot. labyrinth rukkah would also take 10 minutes of dealing with the minibosses followed by 20 minutes of beating damage sponge rukkah who can't even fight back for the whole 20 minutes an absolute insane test of patience. this is not challenging it's lazy artificial difficulty.\n- event dungeons feel like they're balanced for the equivalent of a lvl 85 ss+ character. either that or they're tuned for 4 players. tho that doesn't explain some attacks can deal 50% of my max hp from the other side of the room or how aron can 3 hit instant juggle you to death with his giant hitbox all around him.\n- gacha seems to be the main money sink. testing the free scrolls you can receive from attendance and leveling it seems like you get a piece every 5 or so pulls that's 10 scrolls. a full set is 15 pieces + pet. assuming you need 150 scrolls that's a little less than 60usd for 1 set and 1 pet for 1 character.\n- gacha sets use the same slot as costumes but they have stats and set stats. so if you want to use your costume alongside gacha stats then you have to pay for a relatively expensive item that lets you combine both. and hopefully you will never change your costume ever again because otherwise you would need to buy another one.\n- pets. if you don't buy a gacha pet good luck for endgame simple as. you can't even farm a mid tier boss pet drop in champion or event dungeon due to how expensive/rare tickets are. for reference a xenia champion run will get you something like 4 ores and you need 650 to make astaroth that's 163 days of login champion tickets for 1 pet for 1 character.\n- champion/event tickets effectively can only be bought once every 2 days. and only with the amy update we finally get 1 of each for free from login.\n- desync/speedup animations on some attacks like enemy jumps faster than the original version and the animation is lying about the dodge timing. you can even see the landing dust animation floating midair way before actually touching the ground.\n- because of the change on some physics when sliding off a platform mid skill casting if you get suck'd out of a platform even while on iframes the game will completely ignore gravity and continue with the animation as you're being pulled. but because you're floating you can't cast a new skill to extend your iframes so you're almost guaranteed to die against instakill vortex.\n- character balance is a mess. ryan's nephilim and arme still completely trash on everyone's else average dps till endgame starts. after that a good pet and mp recovery can more or less balance dps.\n- some quests require the use of specific skills from the skill tree. which means that you're forced to equip a 1st job weapon and invest sp into unlocking those skills. this has two problems: 1) you end up having to carry other people on low tier classes / classes they don't know how to use / they don't even have a decent weapon for. and 2) most classes don't have enough point to grab everything so you can lock yourself from either completing the quest or unlocking the good skills. unless of course you pay for a sp reset card.\n- you can't reinforce equipment using another character's money. so you can completely fuck up your main's card/reinforce upgrades by using your limited quest money on potions and gems instead of buying your items on alts. and on a similar note you should be transferring all the items you intend to sell your main so your main barely has enough money to keep enhancing gear.\n- coincidentally all 5 of my relic tier pieces have a wasted slot with gp +0.30% and still haven't seen a single gp reset scroll drop. assuming all stats have the same chance of showing up that's a 4/11 chance of happening per piece. then the chance to see it happen in all 5 pieces is 0.635%. isn't that weird? thankfully kog will just sell you gp reset scrolls for real money.\n- the store is a mess to navigate.\n- no equipment in the gp store if you want a piece for a costume gotta go farm it yourself.\n- you can just buy potions and resurrection items with real money and brute force pretty much any fight lmao.\n- global chat is full of bots spamming how much they want to sell me their 1337 hacks. and every post every 2 seconds comes with a sound effect that's going to follow you for as long as you're not in dungeons or you manually go block every active bot at the time.\n\nand there's more to say.\n\nbottom line:\nveterans and whales might find something out of this game. but i don't see new players enjoying the endgame experience. hell even starting from xenia it's almost guaranteed they're going to constantly run out of revives until they know optimal positioning for bosses.",2021-09-11,2021-10-04,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False

let's make reduce the quality of life so players who expected better have to pay for it.\n\n[h1]pros:[/h1]\n[b]unlocked skill tree for all:[/b] this is really the only good thing about this version of gc that i can think of. old skill tree had cash skills that required cash keys to unlock that’s no longer the case but even this is barely an upside as i will explain in the cons section.\n\n[b]guild system:[/b] there’s bonuses for being in a high level guild but… not super impactful nor does it make up for the onslaught of flaws.\n\n[h1]personal dislikes:[/h1]\n[b]delayed access to job advancements:[/b] why are character job advancements at 204060 now instead of 203040? early progression is easy but grinding the same dungeon at higher levels is repetitive. granted old gc (any dungeon only game tbh) had the same problem of being repetitive but this version is truly a pain with dodge removed from skill tree and skills doing low damage. tbh i stopped playing at 60 because i'm too weak to run 4th job advancement mission dungeons due to: not enough gear drops monsters hit like a truck can't dodge don't do enough damage will lag hardcore if someone is willing to carry me. guess you could solve this issue by paying for the cash job advancement mission instead.\n\n[b]delayed character introductions:[/b] hype only lasts so long and it’s usually over new products. people who play this game are veterans we know the roster we know their skills delaying character release makes absolute zero sense. the company dangle character releases over us hoping to keep our attention but i can only imagine this being bad for business. there will be dio/ley/zero/rufus/rin mains who won’t be bothered to wait that long. when their main character gets released and they try out the game only to see all the flaws with it they’re going to quit. no amount of hype and anticipation is going to be worth it if the payoff is garbage.\n\n[h1]cons:[/h1]\n[b]features removed:[/b] daily attendance: i used to log on to this game even when i had homework just to listen to the music while i did homework so that i could collect the champion tickets and monthly accessory rewards. with that system removed how can a player expect to enter champion mode? there’s a newcomer’s attendance system that lasts 2 weeks but what comes after? why was this feature removed in the first place? marriage feature is also removed. emoticon collection removed. pet attacks restoring mana removed. gp shop removed. if it’s good it’s removed. guess you could solve this issue by buying some vp.\n\n[b]hackers:[/b] hackers run rampant and there are literal ads for hacks in the megaphones. each patch bans some hackers but what’s stopping them from hacking on a different account? how impressive is a your lv 70 character if hackers can get to lv 80 in a day? banning only does not solve the root of the issue the anti-cheat program needs work. guess you could solve this issue by buying some hacks.\n\n[b]lag:[/b] incredible lag when another player is in the same lobby as me. my game would run like a slideshow. this has caused me to run most dungeons solo. could also be a bug but this game first came out over a decade ago there really shouldn't be performance issues in 2021. guess you could solve this issue by buying some vp.\n\n[b]shop:[/b] mana potions removed accessories are now cash items gp armor removed only cash armor in shop. this makes item drops so much more important as you can no longer buy them. at higher level dungeons however you might need more people to help and that means you’ll have to split your already low drop rate with a friend for an item that might not be for your character that you’d have to transfer with the super awesome storage system. the dungeon clear’s reward screen where you choose a box used to have 1 empty box out of 4 now it’s 2 empty boxes 99% of the time. all these nerfs feel like a deliberate push towards cash equips just because you’ll have trouble getting gear at higher levels. guess you could solve this issue by buying some vp.\n\n[b]character slots:[/b] back in the day characters were unlocked with a mission you can buy with gp from shop. in this version you have a limited amount of character slots that can be used to unlock any character. i had to specifically separate this from the shop section because having a roster and collecting all the heroes is something many players strive for. i can easily see this as another nerf for monetization. i would not be surprised to see character slots sold for vp in the future. guess you could solve this issue by buying some vp.\n\n[b]skills:[/b] skill tree heavily nerfed. characters that had dodge in their kits (elesis lass jin with z+down) are removed universal dodge is removed. skills do much less damage. raven walker (lass 3rd bar) used to one shot the room now it’s comparable to an auto attack. i’ve heard similar complaints of arme’s meteor as well. i can understand if this was done to balance for pvp but why does that affect pve dungeons so much? as a player that mained lass and jin for their flexible dodging abilities this was one of my biggest disappointments. guess you could solve this issue by buying some vp.\n\n[b]last but far from least inventory:[/b] inventory size heavily nerfed and now individual. there is a tiny storage system if you want to pass items between characters but it seems like a hassle when old gc had a shared inventory and each character just got whatever item put into their respective inventories. if you want to craft anything you have to muster up every item off every character through the tiny storage system to pass around. have fun scrounging every character inventory just to see how many ruby dusts you have. even cash pets and the gc club premium are no exception. you buy a cash pet it’s for 1 character only (unless you pass it through storage which i don’t even know for certain is possible nor am i willing to spend money on this company to find out). also your base inventory is 190 and it takes cash just to increase one character's inventory by 10. at least in the old gc an inventory increase applied to everyone because inventory was shared. your business model should not be based on quality of life changes. ironically i would have considered buying pets if inventory was shared and all my characters had access to them. crests aren’t shared either. unlocking a high level crest for all your characters may literally take over a thousand runs. what an unnecessary convoluted garbage system. i can’t think of a single argument on why this change would have a morsel of positive influence on the game. what a joke. guess you could solve this issue by buying some vp.\n\n[h1]verdict:[/h1]\ni really want to recommend this game i do but saying this game is a hollow shell of its former self is an understatement. every fan wants their beloved game to be successful so they can introduce it to their friends but sadly grandchase classic is not the case. this re-release had every potential to be something amazing but instead its revival is somewhere between tragic and insulting. every positive aspect of this game was gutted or removed and the devs still have the gall to dangle character release dates like carrots on a stick. this game’s business model is all about making the players' life harder so that they’re more likely to spend money. all the positive reviews are about how this game is nostalgic and tugs on our heartstrings but sooner or later the rose tinted glasses will come off. guess you could solve this issue by buying some vp.",2021-09-04,2021-09-10,False,3,1,0.502914369106292725,0,False,False,False

[/b]\n\ni remember the good old times when i would come back from school the first thing was to turn on my noisy pc and spending the rest of my evening playing with my friends either doing the same mission over and over or getting my ass kicked on pvp it built a nice memory. despite being almost the same game as before it didn’t reach my expectations with this relaunch not because of the mechanics but a few things that i’ll get in depth through this review…\n\n[list]\n\n [*] [u] [b] kog [/b] [/u] – what to say about this company that abandoned this game years ago…? they had a few opportunities to sell this game for people that loved and would do something good but here we are with a greed release looking like the only goal is to milk this game until the last drop left.\n [*] [u] [b] system [/b] [/u] – the system is the same from years ago they didn’t change anything and it’s bad. nothing seems to work as it should noticeable delay easy to develop cheats and filled with bugs that even raised a movement called #savegrandchase.\n [*] [u] [b] pay to win [/b] [/u] – they really went all in with monetization removing the armor and weapons with in-game currency limiting your inventory space behind a paywall giving advantage with cash equipment and not implementing regional pricing for brazil. if you are not willing to pay your progression will get severely affected making you play absurd amount of time for the same reward… [b] a shameless cash grab by kog. [/b]\n[*] [u] [b] progression [/b] [/u] – start’s off really fast you are able to level every 1 or 2 missions you play but by the time you reach level 60 and preparing to get 4th class might take you days to get it with just a lot of repetition forcing you to play the same mission so many times. imagine the same scenario with every character.\n[*] [u] [b] pvp [/b] [/u] – this made me feel like i was once again playing on dial-up internet it’s frustrating getting so much delay for a pvp match not only to fall against cheaters from time to time and cashers have a real good advantage with this system all these issues didn’t make me miss pvp at all.\n[/list]\n\nmy main reason for returning to this game was to relive great memories i had but once again i feel like i’m witnessing the death of grand chase only for kog to earn all the money they can. the game also leaves much space for toxicity moderation is completely abandoned here in brazil people can advertise their cheats or even be racist without any consequences not to mention the largest player base do not have regional pricing…\n\nhonestly it was fun but also a frustrating experience. i really tried to get invested but without my friends and so many issues i just don’t find the will to play with more than one character being most of them locked to be released over time.

that having fun with this game is impossible? no not at all.\n\nbut the fact is that grandchase whether it's this re-release or the original game from way back in 2003 is for a very specific crowd. and you can tell pretty quickly if you're in that crowd or not. all that aside let's get down to brass tacks.\n\n[u]pros[/u]\n\n+ for how old the game is the music kinda slaps\n+ tons of characters (there's only four right now but more will be coming soon™) with different playstyles within each one depending on the weapon you use\n+ characters have unique personalities (and are color-coded) so you always know which is which in any given situation\n+ light-hearted and low energy. if you want an mmo that you just kill an hour with this is a good one.\n+ tons of pets and gear to customize your look\n+ as far as drop rates go this game is more generous than most mmorpgs and certain modes all but guarantee dropping the highest quality stuff for you level\n\n[u]cons[/u]\n\n- early 2000s-tier grinding\n- nice as the music is the audio is mixed terribly\n- very poorly balanced. some characters and specific jobs are just out-and-out superior to others be it movement damage or just how much fun they are to play\n- controls are floaty and awkward\n- hitboxes are mystifying. like monster hunter: freedom unite-levels of making no sense.\n- because of the above 3 reasons pvp is just miserable\n- upgrading gear is an rng gamble that is borderline spiteful in terms of how low the success rate is\n- rng can be sidestepped by way of cracking open your wallet and buying enhancement boosters\n- speaking of wallets guess what you need to do to get most of the pets and the good gear... go on i can wait\n- did i mention this game also has a character-specific lootbox system?\n- and to transfer items for other characters between different characters you need to use a pitifully small storage?\n- and also most of the best gear you can get as drops for other characters can't be put in storage so if you get great rare-drop gear for your archer and you're playing your knight... sucks to be you\n\nnot to mention that inventory used to be massive and shared across all characters which you could hot-swap between in a dungeon lobby. but now they have individual inventories that are pretty damn small and you need to leave the game itself to switch to a different character even if you wan to just... run the same dungeon with a different character. you used to be able to do this because unlocking characters was mission based. finish a quest add the character to your roster. easy. but now they're set as individual characters that need character slots in order to have them [strike]so that for characters beyond the first four require you to buy more character slots.[/strike] (tentatively removing this negative because with the re-release of ryan it seems like they'll just give players an extra slot with each new character. we'll see how long this trend actually holds.)\n\nthese changes and more were informed by as near as anyone can tell trying to take your money. anyone who has played kog' games knows that they are hungry fro you cash. look at kurtzpel. ask anyone who has played elsword. kog' makes their priorities very clear and speaking as someone who watched grandchase get more and more money-hungry over time... it hurts on an deep level.\n\nso... where does that leave us?\n\n-conclusion-\n\ngrandchase had a lot going for it and was super impressive back when it came out but as it stands this game isn't going to do anything that will surprise you now. it's unclear if they'll even be adding new content to the game or not. even the veterans don't really have any idea what's going on. so... i guess if nothing else you can join us in complete and total confusion as to why the chase has even begun again... or where it'll go from here. i can recommend it as fun little time capsule of the mmorpgs of yesteryear or as a nostalgia trip. but as a new game to try out if you're looking for a new exciting mmorpg to play?

fact it introduces more problems either due to laziness incompetence greed or some combination thereof.\n\nto keep this legible i will simply bullet my main complaints:\n\n1. no remaster attempt no release event and very limited content. pvp is just as buggy and laggy as ever. and the balance attempts for most characters seem random at best or calculated to encourage buying vp at worst. i consider this all a manifestation of a zero-effort cash grab game launch.\n\n2. insane vp prices for anyone whose national currency is devalued in comparison with the usd. imo this just shows they truly don't give a shit if they won't even bother to adjust the pay to win stuff for the largest portion of their audience. they genuinely just see us as cash cows... it seems.\n\n3. no dungeon beyond xenia has been released. this means once you hit level 70-75 and you've cleared fortress of ascension half a dozen times you are left with nothing. you can buy the 4th skill quests but can't complete them. they removed champion tickets both from gp shop and daily attendance so you can't farm pets gate ore unique equipment or anything else like that. hero dungeons open once an hour and can only be run twice so have fun managing that if you're lucky. there are no ways to get event tickets outside of spending real money. you can grind dimensional door if you want to become suicidal from boredom but that's about it. funnily enough the one thing that is worth grinding is pvp which gives you good xp/gp level-relevant equipment and the possibility for reinforcement stones/hero's bullion (only if you win of course). sad that the pvp is absolute shit though.\n\n4. they removed the ability to toggle stat normalization in pvp but at the same time the new automatic balancing system does not touch secondary stats such as crit. chance and damage bonus. again i view this as encouraging people to spend vp on gacha since that's the easiest way to hit crit. % of 40+. there are a few other weird changes like this for example you can no longer edit a room name while in lobby. qol stuff but annoying nonetheless.\n\n5. character job quests are the same between characters. since these take about 10 20 and 30 dungeon runs respectively for each job this is not fun at all.\n\n6. the game is not stable for instance it took me twice the number of tries that it should have to unlock lass's 4th job. this is because i would cd on sanctum of destruction (a hero dungeon--last mission for job 4 is 4 clears) almost every time i got to the boss room. i don't know if this is a rampant issue but i've spoken to at least half a dozen na players with the same issue. i can guarantee you it is not my ryzen 1400/nvidia 1070 combo that is failing to step up to the plate here.\n\n7. hacking is rampant with no counterefforts in sight. ironically this would be a much bigger concern if pvp were worth playing or if the game itself weren't so empty of things to do. \n\n8. for some reason now you share even fewer things between characters... pets and gp are what come first to mind. this change was very obviously made with vp in mind.\n\n9. they dropped the character unlock missions that the game was known for (and which were actually an enjoyable part of the grind) in order to push character slots. afaik you can't even buy more slots right now but before the game shut down previously they were selling them with vp. it's probably just an oversight not to have it available now but i really hope they combine the two systems such that completing a gp mission to unlock a character also gets you an extra slot for that character.\n\nit's a shame because kog have actually managed to do more harm than good to the original grand chase title with this relaunch attempt. i say this because many of the private servers that were started after the game's shutdown fixed a lot of these issues lowered cash prices created new events and end-game content offered more opportunities for in-game farming of powerful items and even offered better server stability. i was glad for the relaunch because i knew it would mean an increased player count but by god have they botched this up.\n\ni hope i am wrong and that kog decides to develop this game properly. this will depend on character relaunch events how they choose to address the gp shop going forward their efforts to increase server stability and how they intend to rectify the content void beyond level 70. my expectations are already set very low however not only based on the relaunch but on how kog has handled their mobile game for the past few years. anyone with exposure to that should not be surprised that kog has doubled down on the pay-to-win mechanics within the classic version.\n\nwith all this said some of the developers behind the original grand chase were wonderfully dedicated to the game and receptive to the community. this was in large part what made the game what it was. i have no idea if any of the original moderator team or developers still remain but if so it's up to them to save this dumpster fire.\n\ntl;dr: game rerelease is a cash grab save your time and money for something else or for when this game gets the proper attention. if you miss grandchase more than anything and never got to play on a private server well i guess it's worth the nostalgia for the first couple of hours. at most play it now if you have total faith that kog will make it worth playing later just to take advantage of some of the quest bugs and the early access that the game is basically in. but don't be like me and

(also the names i’ll be using are the br ones so cut me some slack)\nthat's right they released again to get money from the sorry few that wished the game didn't close and has hopes that giving money to kog will magically solve all its problems.\n\nlet me start with my critics from way back then:\n\n- bad control remapping (this is more personal because i love remapping controls);\n- clunky ui that freezes for 0.3s at every press and janky input system for the actual game (some characters use z x and c some only z);\n- game crashes way too often in and out of stages;\n- some bugs are part of the experience like ottoshots;\n- the crystal a boss drop is randomly given to any player in the party after you defeat them which discourages playing in a team since a lot of crystals are needed to craft useful weapons and accessories that are part of a set;\n\nthrough the years they made lots of changes but for the classic they took all the good changes away and let only the bad ones stay:\n\n- monsters does more damage but you can't dodge;\n- ai is dumber but the sheer amount of hp they have makes impossible to solo and again [i] no dodge[/i];\n- more party members equals more hp to the monsters so playing in groups is not the solution for the problem above and sometimes makes you take more time than if you tried solo;\n- no difficulty options except hero mode which you need a ticket that's most of the time paywalled but now the currency is the premium ones (vp bought with real money and daily points which are scarce only 1000 per day) not the common (gp);\n- absurdly low drop rates and no shops for armor which makes impossible to easily craft powerful sets like viktor’s cazeaje’s and thanatos’s;\n- inventory is character based instead of account based so it's an unnecessary hassle to exchange items [b] with yourself [/b]\n- monsters give less exp and missions give more forcing you to play all the stages more times than before just so you can be in the recommended level for the next one which starts to be a drag in ellia since around level 40 the monsters and bosses take ages to die;\n\nthat’s bad enough already but i still need to address what they changed this time:\n\n- new interface with shortcuts that conflict with previous shortcuts. usually you pressed f to check set bonuses but now it opens the forge and leaves you wondering if they actually playtested this;\n- stupidly bad machine translation for portuguese that is even worse than some of the hentai games steam has. the forge is the highest offender for this one;\n- nerfed some characters to oblivion. lass’s tornado assault just tickles elesis don’t learn her natural dodge anymore and even her 4th job don’t have it’s natural dodge… i can’t even start to imagine what they’ll do to the other characters speaking of which…\n- only 4 playable characters from the 20 that originally were. i was hyped to play as amy sieghart rey lupus lin and holy but they’re not here yet and we don’t have a clue when they’ll come. combined with the fact that the equipment drops are very few you can actually get equipment for characters that aren’t even released yet which seems to me like a middle finger from kog;\n- and for the dodge there was a lv10 quest that gave you the stamina bar which let you dodge like ssbu (to the sides and in place on the ground and to the sides on air) and every character could use it making some slow characters like ryan and holy more fun and easier to play early on. we don’t have it right now but the stamina bar is [b] clearly [/b] visible in the hud which is another middle finger from kog;\n- no “my home” which would let us water a tree that eventually gave us daily buffs of atk def exp and such and finally a whopping 15% bonus to all of our stats. that was the main reason many players played every single day it gave a clear goal and a short and long term reward and they just took it middle finger [b]again[b]!.\n- there’s another detail about the lack of gp armor shop: you’re stuck with whatever armor the game wants to give you. i’m level 64 and still have a 51 boots just because the game refuses to give me one. usually you craft a sharkaron set on level 63 but without drops to disenchant i have no materials and am stuck with a lv51 boots.\n- the red square indicating a new equip won’t go off unless you actually equip it the same is for some recipes on the forge or the reward system. i’ve seen mobile games that are better than that.\n- and the point you all were waiting for the vp prices: they deserve their own section below;\n\n[hr][/hr] \n\nits absurdly high for brazilians. seriously i bought around r$200 total in small doses while growing up and was happy with i could buy. two reward systems (for the pets) a lot of visual tickets and transparent accessories i bought holy with cash and i’m not ashamed to admit it every time i was happy with what i bought for what i spent. the best part is that they came with magazines and posters. you can search online some people collected every one of them. i have my berkas poster to this day. besides the cash you gained something else. something real tangible with monetary and sentimental value.\n\nnow it’s reduced to a micro transaction at inflated prices that are unattainable for most of the people and only serves to fuel it’s gacha/lootbox system. r$105 for 20k vp which can buy 60 opening scrolls for the reward system and 10 customization coupons with the change. 60 scrolls can’t get even 30% of the rewards.\n\nwith 20k cash back in the day you could get so much more it’s sad that most people are unable to buy something useful (not that i would) with [i] more money [/i] than before. sure inflation and all that but that doesn’t justify the rise of the prices of the in-game items as well.\n\nagain it seems they only brought the game back to milk those desperate old fans which is very scummy.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nanother point that deserves a different section is the closed beta. [i] [b] why would they do one to get feedback and change absolutely nothing? [/b] [/i]\n\nlots of people complained about the hero tickets the lack of gp armor shop and stamina bar and low amount of playable characters but what did they did? what they should’ve done when they considered re-releasing the game: nothing.\n\nfrom the top of my head these are the issues. now let me tell you about the good changes:\n\n- events are open on a daily basis changing every day and all of them being open on weekends instead of only one lasting two or three weeks.\n- mp characters job changes are levels 20 40 and 60 instead of 20 30 and 40. the lower levels stem from the lower level cap of old versions and never were updated. this is divisive but i think is a good change since some 4th jobs are the absolute best some characters get (like elesis sieghart and amy).\n\nand that’s it. only 2 positives in this mess of game.\n\ntldr: someone wished for gc to come back with the monkey’s paw now i’m gonna find that person get the paw and wish to end gc again.\n\n[url=https://imgur.com/a/frur1w2] this is a tldr too [/url]",2021-08-05,2021-08-05,False,2,0,0.53182297945022583,0,False,False,False

[/b]\n\n------------------------------\n\n[h1] my experience [/h1]\n\nthe state that the game was released in is nothing short of lazy and shameful. from the moment of the announcement that  let us know that grand chase was back and the global release of the game was available we were already forced to deal with what would be only the start of a seemingly endless supply bugs glitches neglect greed and overall poor design/management choices.\n\nmost players myself included were unable to access the game for approximately 3 hours after the initial release due http errors and a korean error message that read the connection to the login server failed. exit the program. once i finally managed to open the game i was only able to make it as far as the server list as kog was severely unprepared for the plethora of players (roughly 75000) that were trying to play their game. there were very few severs all of which were full.\n\na rough start but plenty of other games have had similar issues on launch and i can understand why companies would prefer to see how many players they will have [i] before [/i] spending the money to upgrade/add more servers to their game.\n\nafter a while i was finally able to make it into the actual game and create a character which is when i learned that there are only four characters in the game (elesis lire arme and lass). kog stated that they plan on adding the other characters in future updates in order of original release. for most of us who are returning players it is in my opinion a bad choice to not allow us access to most of the characters who we either mained or simply enjoyed playing and switching between. this choice is especially weird considering i would later find out that you can still get gear for characters that aren't in the game yet. i can only imagine how long the process will be for all of the characters to be re-released.\n\ni pressed on made a character and began playing the game. during my time playing i experienced great amounts of lag freezing having my cursor turn invisible game crashes inability to turn in quests infinite loading screens teleporting enemies invisible enemies being kicked out to the server menu and much more. it should also be noted that none of the maps have any difficulty after 'normal' besides 'champion' of which you are unable to purchase champion tickets for in order to access (unless you want to spend real money) whereas you were able to purchase champion tickets in the old game for 200000 gp each in the gp shop.\n\nmost of the text in the game also falls victim to poor translation at least for english speakers as there are four main audience types; south american and asian (the majority) north american and european. some things are just straight up untranslated and in korean whereas a lot of other things are in broken english. interestingly however despite most of their audience being from south america i've seen a lot of people complain about vp (a currency bought with real money) pricing not displaying in south american currency for south american players.\n\nafter making and playing several characters i also noticed that almost nothing is shared between them. inventory gold pets and even gc club/premium gc club are not shared. each character is almost like their own account with the exception of certain items that can be put in the warehouse and transferred between characters and vp.\n\nspeaking of the characters none of them have any skill trees beyond their 1st job's skill tree and even then it feels as if the 1st job's skill trees are missing some skills (although i could just be remembering incorrectly). all of the jobs beyond the 1st only have their base skills their ultimate skill (if you unlock it) and the shared skills between all jobs. this means that despite there only being four characters to play they are all missing the majority of their skills and passives despite the fact that you can unlock all of their jobs. players also now only have 1 life in dungeons as opposed to 3. there was a time where we only had 1 life but this was due to the addition of a dodge skill that was implemented into most characters skill trees which is not currently present despite the fact that we only have 1 life.\n\nit is also to my understanding from reading various other reviews and seeing what people are saying on the grand chase discord/reddit that most if not all of the bugs/problems that were present in the cbt (closed beta test) are still in the currently released version of the game. the one exception to this seems to be the vp pricing on the items in the item mall which they actually [i] raised [/i] from what they were in the cbt.\n\non the topic of the shops the gp shop is very limited while the vp shop or item mall contains exceedingly overpriced items. there is also a seal breaker gacha which on average seems to require about $180-$200 usd if you want the full set which is an unreal amount to spend on something like that especially considering that the current gacha isn't even for an actual set of gear it's for a coordi/costume set (which has fairly low stats) and a pet. even the seal breaker's that we had in the original game for [i] actual gear [/i] with really good stats didn't cost that much.\n\nthe game also only has continents going up to xenia meaning that there is a lot of missing content from the game despite the fact that you can still level up to 85. this makes it so you can get stuck on a character granted you level them up enough as there isn't content high enough level for certain quests like the ones where you are required to kill monsters that are within 2 levels of yourself. you also get epic (orange) gear very easily from doing quests removing the sense of progression you used to get from farming for good gear in dungeons. even still you can be in a full set of epic gear with good property rolls and the enemies in dungeons still feel impossibly tanky/strong even though the difficulty is only on 'normal'.\n\nnext comes the hackers who are spamming their twitch.tv streams discord ids websites and other platforms on which they can advertise and sell their hacks for the game. these people are actively live streaming themselves using auto-kill hacks speed hacks auto-ss hacks one-hit hacks etc. and don't appear to be receiving any kinds of punishments whatsoever despite also spamming the in-game general and global chats.\n\n------------------------------\n\n[h1] final thoughts [/h1]\n\ni love this game and i always will and i wish from the bottom of my heart that it succeeds but if this release is indicative of anything then i don't think that it will make it very far.\n\ni've experienced most of what this release currently has to offer (lv. 30 elesis / lv. 75 lire / lv. 61 arme / lv. 56 lass) and in the state that it's currently in i wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy.\n\n------------------------------\n\n[h1] tl;dr [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]if you're here for nostalgia or a good/fun game you won't find it\n    [*]buggy lazy sloppy mess\n    [*]the game feels different compared to what it once was due to rebalancing\n    [*]only 4 characters currently available with others to follow in order of release in future updates\n    [*]characters only have a skill tree for their 1st job nothing more\n    [*]barely any content\n    [*]almost nothing is shared between characters\n    [*]hackers/cheaters everywhere you look\n[/list]",2021-08-03,2021-08-03,False,75,0,0.838123321533203125,0,False,False,False

well yes sort of. if you really know how to play it will easily shine through but the chances of you being mistaken for those who are macroing is very very high because of the tight inputs you really need to do to actually do something that isn't a 3-second animation lock.\nah i have mentioned lire and arme a few times here and good luck trying to pvp with them. their normal movement and combo kit is so piss poor that they resort to cheap skills most of times (arme's mp1- petrify is a good exemple) and culturally (south america/brazil) you will be kicked out of the pvp lobby as soon as you switch to those characters.\n\nnot to mention the whole refining system all over again.. kog really loves doing this and holy hell good luck getting your weapons up to the refining grade you want because you will need either a lot of patience or a lot of money.\n\npve will eventually force you to most likely get some cash in to get extra revives if you're trying to solo content (whether that or getting some good ass gear on the rewards system plus the awesome looking pet) because i'll tell you without the proper information on how your character works.. you will most likely be flattened down by enemies who have almost all times poorly-designed cheap tatics to kill you. one time favorite of kog's is to spam super armor frames on almost all attacks fill the room with those monsters and call it a day. another one is big aoes anything that can stunlock you or cc you out or your mind. you better get that mari lageas (4th class) going and a whole bag full of potions to clear some content if you're not geared enough for it.\n\nkog has taken the approach of time-gating content (especially characters and the gacha/ice-burner/rewards system) which is an easy way to pad and proxy people to come back to their game as if it was a wow it's a launch of a new character! meanwhile some people in the beta glitched and could create characters that weren't the first intended three which is enough to say that they *do* have the characters in the game already it's just really time-gated under their own 'roadmap' if it's even fair to call it that.\n\nand with that long and emotion filled rant about this launch i feel it's again safe to say that we all just really wished for a grandchase 2 (elsword's combo system but better and all the old characters and story we love) but we got none of that. just pretty much a private server that's being oficially hosted by the developer itself- hell even the private servers that were around had a lot better balancing and actual care put into the damn game.\n\nfrom here there are a few outcomes:\ngame stays gets minimal development after the time gating basically to be able to say it isn't in maintenance mode!\ngame stays in maintenance mode indefinitely after the time-gating stops with kog just cashing out on it and letting a few servers.\nand now for the more unlikely:\ngame actually starts seeing further development.\ngame gets remade grandchase2 is real and elsword is dead.\n\nedit: kog plz\nedit2: nerfcity.",2021-08-02,2022-11-23,False,296,9,0.926134228706359863,0,False,False,False

\nthe game is a copy of the old game from 10 years ago with very small changes and a lot of content cut. the game was grindy before but but its far worse due to lack of shared inventory missions and unique quests being locked to higher levels and behind extreamly dificult challanges. while i can understand clasic aspect of it a reason to keep things like they were they still found ways to do very little while taking away so much i am also nostalgic for the game and i have played it for 3 days now giving it an honest shot and trying to document changes and see what is different. \nanother huge issue worth mentioning is that the game and its way of monetizing is right out of 2000's. where pay to win formula worked this is 2021 these style of games have long since been outdated and there is a good reason nobody uses that anymore. while the game is nostalgic gateway to those old times it still has issues that it had even back then and i fear it wont survive this climate if it doesnt adapt and modernize and if this poor buggy unbalanced uncustomizable and overblown launch is any indication of how kog treats their game it will quickly fail like it did so many years ago. and this saddens me. \nmy prediction is that they will slowly release old characters and content with very little change compared to the old game to give people a feeling of progress and keep the servers running for a while to cashgrab and get some money of peoples nostalgia. i genuinely hope the game survives and they actually work with the community to update and make the game decent actually introducing proper content and pushing the game beyond what it once was but knowing kog's reputation seeing their past actions and seeing how underwhelming and poor this release was... i dont have high hopes.\n\nthis review was long but i did my best to speak from the heart and underline some issues. best we can do now is wait and see what they do either way. ill hope for the best prepare for the worst.",2021-07-30,2021-07-30,False,213,2,0.889972865581512451,2,False,False,False

96564871,76561198027905286,0,9,101,0,101,2021-07-29,english,"the predecessor to elsword.   back some 14 years ago or so this game took the mmo community by storm. by the end of its run it became a disgusting corpse trying to  copy mechanics that worked in elsword but completely broke this game.\n\n\n\nback when elsword was extremely new when rena and aisha were called lire and arme when elesis was only rumored to be the girl in the silhouette; the dynamic trio was kickin' ass in grand chase. \n\n\ngrand chase was far more skill-based in its pvp than elsword was elsword became known as the ''watered down'' grand chase back in the day. in elsword you relied on stats and some generic combos(at the time the game has evolved greatly since then). in grand chase you needed to be able to utilize ''unintended'' mechanics such as shadow-stepping rocket-stepping ottoing etc.  i can only speak for the na community but it was extremely frowned upon to ''stat up'' in pvp often times most players would limit their stats to only rank b in their rooms. this probably made the game difficult to monetize for kog and could arguably be what caused the extremely aggressive pay2win mechanics that were added in from elsword.\n\n\nbut the biggest problem i had with grand chase is the characters power creep. back then characters were all truly unique. elesis for example had 4 unique playstyles her first job her second job changed her kit entirely and she used a spear third job she used a great sword and her 4th job dual wielded swords. elesis was the ''least unique'' character across jobs most playing as an extended offshoot of her first job....but the other characters changed drastically.  it was so exciting to see the teasers for new jobs to come out often people speculating on what they would be.\n\neventually they added this stupid feature called skill trees.  now elesis at her first job could do anything her future jobs could do. she could attack twice in mid-air she had an immediate triple-tap to do a rocket step she could dodge roll like jin(which invalidated her 3rd jobs shadow attack) etc.  there was even less reason to use her other jobs thanks to this this problem only continued as they released skill trees for the other characters. most rooms that would limit stats also limited skill trees in pvp because they were so weird broken and a poor fit for the gameplay of grand chase compared to elsword.\n\n\n\nthen when they couldn't sink any lower they did. someone on the development team must have thought ''you know what? elswords pretty popular lets freaking add in the instant-casting specials on a new character'' and they added dio. this was a huge breaking point for the game.  in grand chase you had to hold down the attack button to ''charge'' your mp letting it go depending on how long you held it down would then unleash a skill depending on your mp. dio could simply press a button and use third-tier specials instantly like characters in elsword can. furthermore he also had his own skill tree capable of doing absolutely insane feats that few other characters could(namely recent ones like prime knight and asura).   this trend continued when they added the character ''zero''. he was just as bad as dio with a tier 1 skill called gran force that slowed anyone hit by it and did a massive dot on them you were pretty much dead as soon as this hit you he also had a special stab move that would steal your hp and fully restoring his in an instant even bringing him out of the ''fatal'' status effect which was a big deal.\n\n\nas if things couldn't get any worse they really upped their ''gacha'' systems not happy enough to ruin the balance of the game they added what are known as ''props''. these essentially are like extra effects on gear that you find in any mmo. they completely broke pvp to levels beyond stupidity. people who spend hundreds of dollars(thousands even) could max their hp recovery to practically immediately regenerate their hp to full by waiting a few seconds. they could max their mp recovery immediately getting to tier-3 mp after just using it. the worst offender was the prop known as ''hell spear''. this idiotic effect had a random chance to strike you with a spear when you took any damage from that character it was unavoidable so even if they just barely did chip damage if their hell spear was high enough it could take half your hp.\n\n\n\nafter realizing how stupid their ap characters were they decided that they were too far beyond the breaking point and decided to make every character like dio allowing them to instantly cast their skills just like ap characters...only it didn't change much. dio still had 4 jobs worth of skill trees while mp characters only had 1 he had a far greater aresenal of moves thanks to his skill tree(and by dio i mean every ap character).\n\n\nin the last days of grand chase they actually did something that was totally based. they allowed players to make a ''rule list'' by banning certain characters ap etc from joining their room. finally people who wanted the skill-based pvp could make a proper ban list of all the stupid crap they added in over the years but most of the playerbase had already left at this point. moving on to elsword or other things growing up and the like.\n\n\n\nthis iteration of grand chase still has ap characters the mp characters are still amp  the gacha system is still there. i haven't extensively tested it yet but i think they actually got rid of the ''ruleset'' update.  it is not worth your time. if you want an arcade-style mmolike anime fighting game you should stick with elsword. i am sure elsword has its problems but it was built from the ground up to include a heavy emphasis on stats and gear grand chase desperately mashed in a bunch of dumb crap over the years to try to grab new players and burned for it.  \n\nit's really a pity grand chase literally used to have national tournaments.  some good players like mooseinatree and the like were literally flown over to participate in these because the game was recognized to some degree as being a very competitive game.  seeing what it is now is just embarrassing. \n\n\ndungeons? don't bother 90% of the characters are so rag-tag and outdated that they cannot even perform well in dungeons while some other characters absolutely destroy dungeons.  the pve aspect of the game has always been meant for the 2005 generation of games and has never evolved beyond that.\n\n\nthe game is great to visit again to fill some minor nostalgia of the good old times but if you're a new player looking for a new game to play i would strongly discourage you from playing this abomination unless you enjoy spending hundreds of dollars to bullshit your pvp opponents with a billion broken props and mechanics.",2021-07-29,2021-07-29,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False

\n[hr][/hr]\nok so i should probably start by addressing the fact that i am voting down a game that i have well over 200 hours of playtime (not counting times i paused or left on the menu overnight). some people are going to love this game. it’s complex very detailed and oh so so fiddly. seriously no judgment that can be fun and some people love it. \n\ni started off kind of liking the game but hating certain meta-game aspects (more later). after about 40 hours i started to actually get it and was swayed to the positive. by the end however the game used its own poor design as an element to make it harder…and i [b]hate[/b] that. for example game elements are optimized to make it easy to simultaneously manage dozens of employees with a god’s-eye-side view…but those same optimizations generally make it harder micromanage anyone…but in order succeed you have to be constantly micromanaging everything.\n\nif you decide to give [i]lobotomy[/i] a shot you [i][b]need[/b][/i] to know several things. first the game expects you to fail and lose your hard-earned employees and gear. but you will learn things about the monsters you are managing. you are then expected to use the “memory point” rewind to go back. you get your dead employees back (but they lose any experience gained or gear) and you keep the knowledge you gained on the monsters. i regularly used the “retry day” option but not the memory point option. that was a [b][i]huge[/i][/b] mistake. i could have saved dozens of hours trying to figure things out and how to properly play the game.\n\nsecond [i]lobotomy[/i] relies heavily on your meta-game knowledge and meta-accomplishments.  unless you do everything exactly right you almost certainly won’t get a good ending…assuming you can even get through the final gauntlet of challenges…and how could you get it right if you haven’t played it before? you are supposed to hit a wall and restart from day 1. when you do that all your monster info gear and facility upgrades stay. employees do restart at level 1…but you can be more careful and pick “safer” monsters to make your next run easier.\n\nthird you are expected to micromanage a ton of things at the same time but the game specifically makes it hard to manage those things. employees have health and sanity bars but they are constantly spewing random nonsense in a bubble [b]that covers up their stat bars![/b] do you need to pull one of your guys out of the fray because they have 2 hp? dunno…maybe you should be paying closer attention to said dude…meanwhile a spore escaped while you were not looking and killed 5 people. it’s like having an arena full of 3-year-olds all screaming for you to play and pay attention to them. monsters do operate by a very specific script…and once you know that script intimately it does become a little easier. but you won’t understand how annoying some monsters are until later and they can make your days very hard (see reset to day 1 option).\n\nlastly [i]lobotomy[/i] does not believe in quality-of-life game elements and views your time as a player as a resource it can abuse for no good reason. take the hp bars again…even if your dude isn’t spewing nonsense about band camp while trying to fight [i]nyarlathotep[/i] you have to pause and zoom way in to see how they are doing. when baddies spawn you have to scour the entire facility zooming in and out to find them…and hopefully they aren’t hiding in a hallway transition. finally in some fights you are not allowed to use the game speed up option. speeding up does nothing to help you win it's quality-of-life to move through the rote & boring parts quickly. nope the game wants you to suffer. why do so many devs not realize those “challenges” straight up make their games less fun?\n\nthe eldritch horror themes and dystopian story were decent. i saw where it was going pretty quickly but there were still a few twists i didn’t anticipate. the story rambles more than it should and can be a bit hard to follow at times when it decides to wax philosophic.\n\ni did start to enjoy the game once i learned enough about the game and monster scripts. then i was able to handle difficult situations relatively easily. i reversed my decision back to dislike when challenges wouldn’t tell you what was going on…and your only clue was in subtle things you ignored for the whole game because they were meaningless before. 90% of people are going to get frustrated and look it up on the internet long before they actually figure it out for themselves. i do not like it when games make it hard for you to figure out what is going on.",2023-12-29,2023-12-29,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,4,False,False,False

140649877,76561198844645186,82,4,410,0,325,2024-03-01,english,"	i find it pretty difficult to recommend this game to people because of a few main reasons. one the sound design is poorly balanced and sounds really really bad in a few key areas (looking at you red dawn). two the gameplay is very repetitive and also has a very bad case of savescumitis which only worsens as the game progresses to the point that i really don't recommend to anyone to commit to finishing it. and finally a lot of aspects of the gameplay in particular the difficulty are quite cbt and not in the fun ‘throw yourself against a problem until you figure it out’ way.\n\n	on the other hand the game is incredibly creative interesting and above all unique. in my opinion video games are at their best when they do things that other games dont do and to do that one must take risks and potentially fail. lobotomy corporation took a risk and for the most part didn’t quite stick the landing. it still made something memorable and hopefully the concept of an esoteric monster facility management sim can be taken and iterated upon by another developer with more technical skill and time.\n\n	let me go over the flaws again before i dig into some particularly interesting concepts and design decisions i like. the sound is atrociously balanced. some sounds are too quiet or nonexistent (there should be audible feedback for employee deaths besides the sounds of their various kills like how frostpunk has a church bell that rings once for every death. if you’re not focused directly on an employee when they die there is no way to tell besides the toast on the left hand side of the screen and if they’re a clerk you get no notification at all!) and some sounds are way too loud! the sounds for the different fixed events that being the dawns noons dusks and midnights are much too loud and earrapey. some idle sounds of monsters are also too loud namely nothing there (which like i understand being that nothing there is supposed to be very threatening but they dont need to be that loud to do that!) but also a few others. that said the sounds themselves are usually just… fine. some stand out goods some stand out bads but mostly everything is just how it should sound and nothing more. \n	i dont really need to go too far into the game’s bad case of savescumitis just that its there and it is a lethal case. thankfully the game does give you quite a few ways to save over and reset from your mistakes but i feel this is more of a bandage for a wider problem of unforgiving gameplay rather than a positive. \n	and as for that difficulty oh god. losing anyone is a huge negative due to the time cost involved in getting each employee even up to snuff. this really overlaps with darkest dungeon where employees are supposed to be disposable and you’re not supposed to get attatched but conversely to that goal employees are very very expensive to train. even with all of the bonuses you can unlock to improve employee training speed (one of which requires a quite difficult boss!) it can still take a good 30 or so real time minutes at max speed to fully train one employee in one in game day. and that entire time you are generating risk of death and micromanaging to avert the risk of that employee dying or worse. you can multitask and train more than one employee at once but there aren't that many abnormalities in the game that are good for training employees and no gym or equivalent slow training. all employees must be live trained at all times. you can spend your employee points to strengthen the employee's stats but it's very expensive and really not worth it. so you spend a ton of time on each employee so that you can have a base of workers and warriors that isn't muppets… and then you get blue midnight or some shit and they all die instantly because you didn't pause the game the instant that you sent urist mcuseless to go train on one sin. and then you reset the day. hence the bad case of savescumitis. \n\n	but what’s really good about this game? well its fucking cool. all of the monsters feel esoteric weird and interesting and it's super fun to learn how they tick and how you can incorporate what they do into your gameplay loop. i’d go into examples but that kinda takes away from the fun of it all and plus i’d be restating what you could easily read on the wiki if you actually care.\n	the story is also a highlight being a pretty interesting concept although not the best written. the characters are fun and interesting there’s an element of mystery and also quite a bit of that sweet sweet ludonarrative harmony (*gags*). lots of the themes in the game and how frustrating it can feel is mirrored in the gameplay and vice versa. elements of the gameplay are integrated well into the story such as the cognition filter explaining why the game looks the way it does. (which also is incorporated into a cool abnormality! if you know you know.)\n	the old testament theming of the game is also quite interesting and unexpected for a game like this. the first abnormality you get in the game kicks off this theme and is iterated upon by the most threatening one. the characters are themed after biblical (angels? i don’t know much about this. might be more jewish rather than christian as well.) and it's well implemented. the story also goes into this in interesting directions in particular the themes of suffering and original sin being mirrored in gameplay somewhat. the theming of this game is original intentional and tightly woven into the experience. very well done.\n\n	speaking of by far my favorite part of the game is the warning level. if you fuck up in some way either by letting an abnormality loose or having employees die the warning level increases which plays banger music and also has some minor gameplay effects. for the most part the warning level is a gameplay way to signal to the player how messed up the facility is and also cause a snowball effect of failure. i don’t like the snowball factor that much but it is in the end interesting which is the end goal of any game. \n\n	\n	so yeah kind of a messy review. i really can’t say i recommend picking up this game off of steam. if it was free i’d say it has interesting ideas that are worth experiencing but if you want a game from this company of a similar or higher quality level that's actually worth your time and money i’d more recommend library of ruina… even though i despise it and everything it stands for due to it being a turn-based rpg card game deck builder. \n\n	overall here are my generalized scores that arent really relevant to anything but my own general thoughts on the game. don’t compare these to scores from other people or even myself on other games. \n\n	personal scores: (overall about a 7-8.5 that fluctuates depending on how cool i think nothing there is that day)\n		fun: 6/10 dwarf fortress does cbt better\n		autism-ility: 8.5/10 was my hyperfixation for a while \n		aesthetics: 7.5/10 accurate corporate hellscape \n\n	somewhat objective scores: (worse than the sum of its parts due to its overall low budget and poor usage of that budget. about a 4 overall)\n		sound design: 4/10 red dawn.\n		game feel: 5.5/10 aggressively mediocre but buggy. commanding an army of goobers is never not satisfying but it toes the line in this game due to how janky combat is.\n		game performance: 3/10 holy fuck how do you fuck this up that bad\n		writing: 8/10 story stuff is fine but the stuff that's hidden in flavor text is great\n		horror score: 8/10 can be actually spooky at times\n		art: 7/10 has a style and is just… fine. game looks bad. \n		the grind: 2/10 is real. and bad. \n		theming: 8.5/10 goes for something particular and nails it even though it's not that fun of an idea.",2023-06-25,2023-06-25,False,1,1,0.484650105237960815,7,True,False,False

problems build up as i went through the game but incase you do get the game my best advice to give would be this.\n\ndon't be afraid of replaying/restarting even from day 1.\nthe games expects you to use memory repository and the only thing you will lose from going back even to day 1 are the employees that you hired and the abnormalities you obtained.\nhowever any items and/or information you obtained from those abnormalities is kept.\nmission progress/completion is also kept even from day 1 resets this makes replaying the game significantly easier so do not be afraid of this or losing employees.\n\nwith that said i actually have a fair amount of nice things to say about the game so let's start off with the\n\n+++positives+++\n\nthe thematics of the game are great!\ni thought the general aesthetic worked really well both for budget reasons and as an intentional style.\nbut beyond graphics there's a lot of horror vibes the store description doesn't lie with what it's inspired by i really liked the scp vibes throughout.\n\nspeaking of scp's the abnormalities are numerous and varied i loved how different a lot of them were and it was surprisingly satisfying figuring out how to manage them all and in the end profit off them.\n\nthe story was also pretty neat though i can't go into depth about it.\ni found my eyes glazing over it a smidge with how it was worded at points but overall i liked how dark it was throughout and how things played out with all of the characters.\n\nlastly the music was also pretty cool at points.\nfor the most part it was kinda samey unless things were going wrong but when things were going wrong it got pretty good.\n\nnow onto the \n\n---negatives---\n\nthe games performance is terrible specifically as you progress.\nwhat started out perfectly smooth devolved into low framerates as the facility expanded to the point where even loading screens came close to crashing the game if i clicked or alt tabbed.\nthis is a problem when you're faced with combat because when particle effects happen the game practically freezes momentarily but everything is combat has particle effects.\ndamage prompts insanity prompts blood splatters everything will cause lag if you use large groups.\nnow while small groups have their benefits being discouraged from using a large group because the games performance will just die along with all my lower level employees feels terrible.\nbut even outside of combat scrolling across the facility is laggy animations get less smooth and for the late game objectives specifically it just feels awful.\n\nto go more in-depth on combat it's really simple. you select employees and you can tell them to either go to a location or attack something and later on in the game you get bullets which let you manually target people to give them shields health sanity or just kill them if they start to become troublesome.\nbut my problem with combat is that it's too simple i cannot tell an employee where specifically i want them in a room i can only tell them i want them in that room. so when i'm fighting an enemy and i want to move them to the other side of said enemy i have to select the employee tell them to go into a room on the other side of the enemy (assuming there even is one otherwise their only option is to either get hit or leave the room entirely) wait for the employee to move select them again and tell them to attack the enemy.\nit's tedious it's clunky and it's one of the reasons i disliked when the game decided to delve more into combat specifically.\n\nspeaking of those objectives from earlier throughout the entire game you're given missions from different people in the facility culminating in a final objective from them. these started off perfectly fine but the last few in particular were just awful.\ni will spoil three of these in particular but these are not major plot spoilers just gameplay ones.\n[spoiler]starting with the disciplinary team i don't understand why they had boss fights be the days objective instead of just collecting energy the game is not built for boss fights as it just devolves into kiting attacks over and over even with your best units. but for your units which aren't the best you just kinda have them on the side lest they die and ruin everyone elses sanity.\nit's a boring fight which you cheese either via kiting or through some other method such as unleashing abnormalities to the work for you which sounds like a smart use of mechanics but it's pretty dull [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]next is the record team this one is just dull. it takes away your ability to pause and manage things (to an extent) but it also removes your ability to speed things up opting to speed things up gradually as the day goes along. i find this extremely boring as most abnormalities don't use time as a mechanic so it just makes the day go extremely slowly and if you need to restart you'll feel every second crawl on by. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]finally we have the extraction team another mission that requires you to finish a boss fight instead of getting enough energy so what this means is more kiting to avoid attacks. the gimmick with this boss is cool you cannot hurt the boss until you deal with specific abnormalities that get put into a meltdown state.\nonce they're vulnerable you have a good chunk of time to wail on them. there are several problems here. she can place her meltdown effect on abnormalities which are already on cooldown meaning you need to wait unnecessarily before you can send someone to deal with it and when the boss becomes vulnerable they stop for a long while even if they're in a doorway transition where you cannot reach their model. if you do not deal with them in this state there is a good chance they'll throw out more meltdowns again all because you literally could not reach them because the game didn't allow you to.[/spoiler]\n\nand going back to general gameplay i really wish the game had more automation.\na lot of days i was just going through the motions it would've been nice if there was some way i could just automatically send people to go do the jobs i would like them to do. replaying days felt boring because very little changed and as the facility expanded the fatigue really set in.\n\nand speaking of the facility i mentioned how i loved the variety of abnormalities earlier but sometimes the game can give you some abnormalities you're just not able to deal with at points.\nsome will get out because you have too many clerk casualties one will get out because you don't have enough clerk casualties some will get out because your employees are too underleveled or undergeared and in the worst case scenario you're getting them on days where a checkpoint is set and going back to said checkpoint fixes nothing. going back isn't bad but the reason for it can definitely feel bad.\n\n>>conclusion<<\noverall there was a lot i like about the game and it started off real strong but it just became so tedious and annoying with what i wanted from me later on.\nit's not devoid of quality and it definitely appeals to some people but i find that it was more annoying than anything else in the later game for me to recommend this personally.",2023-02-24,2023-02-24,False,157,4,0.860116958618164063,11,True,False,False

you can speed up time in this game but not nearly enough. eventually even 2x/2.5x is wildly insufficient for how tedious much of the management phase becomes. \n\n[mod full fix] - very poor conveying of (very important) statistical information to the player. part of the game is obviously to let the player become a manager of a huge byzantine facility and make the best of it. lc however takes this to excessive lengths. the game plays around with giving the player access to information as part of research/story progression (hp/sp of agents/abnormalities as part of a research from one of the ais). lc however does not give info on shield hp/sp numerical hp/sp of agents/abnormalities numerical use-speed/range of weapons numerical success probability with fully understood abnormalities... this is extremely important information to properly manage the facility!\n\n- very poor conveying of spatially-related information. the game will not notify you if someone in the facility is taking damage / in combat nor will it tell you how they died. i suppose this could be a deliberate design decision but it is one that is hugely irritating to me personally. i much prefer the rimworld method of alerting you to threats. also agents can stack on top of one another and then you cant easily see their hp/sp\n\n[mod partial fix] - many models do not display the correct weapon your agent is holding which can cause confusion in the middle of an important suppression.\n\n- again personal opinion but the way the story is conveyed is very very poor. others might not mind this more scattershot type of storytelling.\n\n[mod partial fix] - unacceptable performance issues that can cause memory leaks. i was shocked to see >95% ram utilization (out of 32gb ddr5) by this game one night. be aware you will probably have to limit your play time to a few hours to avoid this. there is also generally poor optimization.\n\n- no spoilers but a good number of the ordeals/bosses in this game are simply boring timesinks that are occasionally frustrating and generally tedious exercises in kiting for minutes on end. late game can be pretty egregious in this regard\n\n- no spoilers but some abnormalities are genuinely run-enders if you are unlucky with their placement or just rely on frustrating mechanics to not cause immense damage (like getting normal results only). getting enough abnormalities that care about agent/clerk deaths can cause spirals that go on to cause resets as well though this is eventually mitigated with execution bullets.\n\n- eventually ~75% of your abnormalities will be completely ignored in favor of more dangerous (more energy producing / more efficient training) abnormalities. i feel this is a missed opportunity wherein we the player have no reason whatsoever to interact with the vast majority of the facility. \n\n[mod full fix] - this game is already painfully tedious and (imo) pointlessly time consuming after enough time has gone on that the players has a good grasp of the game. why can't i queue actions? some consider this part of the management process i consider this forced boring busywork.\n\n- you have no idea how long an agent has been using a tool abnormality and so have to: 1. guess or 2. using a separate abnormality as a makeshift timer or 3. use a real world timer (hope you are not at 1.5/2.5x speed \n in game!). this has genuinely been a huge headache on every run.\n\n[mod full fix] - training employees is a near complete guessing game. perhaps i missed something but until i read the wiki outside the game itself i had not idea how my agents stats were being changed as a result of work/suppression/gifts. this is again very important information that the game doesn't tell you. i feel like im seeing a rather unfortunate trend for a management game.\n\n- this one is subjective but i feel the way clerks are handled is very strange and could have done with a some overhauling. essentially clerks provide you with buffs some of which are fairly important. but eventually you will probably have to cull very large portions of them (usually with execution bullets) to prevent abnormalities from breaching as a response to too many clerk deaths from abnormalities or other events. so you can:\n1. not cull employees and so risk breaches which will probably kill clerks and reduce/lose buffs.\n2. cull employees and so diminish breach risk but also reduce/lose buffs.\nthe player is put in a situation where they have buffs when they least need them (start of day) and dont have them when they most need them.

many of them are at least somewhat interesting and shed light on the strange beings that you have to manage. \n\nand then there's the music. for the most part you'll just hear the same tune (with minor variations) over and over and over and over make it stop and over and over. i have no idea what it is with east asian indie games and excruciatingly repetitive music/10 second loops. but of course when the music stops looping and you get treated to some special tunes they're incredible bangers so you can't even turn the music off.\n\n[h1]genius or fool; they both find madness[/h1]\nnow let's get to the main part. the gameplay. it starts out very engaging. you send your guys to an anomaly sometimes stuff happens sometimes people get hurt; you gain p-boxes and unlock new info about the anomaly or perhaps its associated weapons. you upgrade your guys you get new anomalies. you do the quests given to you by the sephirot (npc managers). everything's fine.\n\nuntil slowly but surely anomalies become harder and harder to manage. people die and you don't know why because you need p-boxes to figure it out but you need successful work in order to get p-boxes. what a conundrum. then suddenly a new ordeal shows up and kills your entire department because you didn't know what it was and wasn't prepared. this causes this strange new anomaly to breach containment and you have to redo the day.\n\nthis game is a paragon of anti-quality-of-life. many higher threat anomalies require conscious action from you the player to be managed correctly/to avoid breaching. you forgot to look at this thing and click here in the last 60 seconds? here is a train that kills half of your facility. you worked with this anomaly too many times with this person? dead. you used a person with the wrong stats? dead. or worse. breach. or both.\n\nafter a while your brain gets torn into pieces trying to balance your attention between the myriad of threats. and since later on there are anomalies that breach when people die (anywhere anyone) it's entirely possible for a simple mistake to snowball into total annihilation. so you have to redo. redo redo redo. 40 minutes of gameplay down the drain. and again again again.\n\nyou could say that this is actually genius. managing dangerous anomalies is supposed to be difficult. but no. the problem here is that you can't delegate can't automate; everything has to be done meticulously by hand day after day. and each mistake is more costly than the last. and the days get longer and longer; easier and easier to slip up...\n\n[h1]deeper circle of sheol[/h1]\nat this point i should note that this game has a story. it's a ridiculously grimdark story about human folly; but it's good. it's so good. you want to see it you want to know. you want to understand the mystery. but in order to do that you have to not only progress with the days - all 50 of them - but also complete sephirot missions as you go. those missions often require you to complete a day under extreme conditions which make the already difficult game a true piece of hell. \n\ni tried. so so many times. that's why i have those 134 hours. because i actually wanted to see what this is about perhaps to get good at the game. but no. maybe it's me. maybe my brain is just to distracted to play this game. and i tried. keeping notes developing protocols; it felt way more like work than my actual work. no. no more.\n\ni implore you: do not play this. or else you'll be trapped in the same loop of despair as me. i managed to break out but i'll always carry that seed with me seed of the ultimate sin of game design: a game with so much unfulfilled potential. let this review be an attempt at redemption and perhaps and act of deliverance from this torment for someone else.",2022-06-20,2022-06-20,False,107,71,0.701455891132354736,0,True,False,False

but can be improved by utilizing the horrors in your base - as your agents interact with the horrors you unlock understanding which is initially used to find out more about the creature in question (what kinds of interactions are more likely to be successful what happens when it gets mad any gotcha's that might exist etc.) but later can unlock themed weapons and/or armor. these are pretty much universally better than your starting gear although some may come with downsides as well. agents train up their stats through usage - the more they interact with horrors the higher their stats. at certain stat intervals they'll gain levels which makes them overall more competent/less likely to panic.\n\neach department also has a coterie of assistants - these are npcs that are always armed with the default mib gear and tend to die horribly whenever something goes wrong. keeping them alive gives various bonuses depending on which department they're part of; but losing them doesn't affect your bottom line like losing agents does.\n\neach day gives you an energy target with a bonus of any missions which you may have unlocked from your ais. as your agents interact with the horrors you'll eventually trigger an agitated state - random rooms in your base will start a countdown. failing to send an agent to them will at the very least cause a loss of energy; beware that some horrors are not appreciative about being ignored.\n\nas i mentioned in the opening the problem with the game is that the only way to figure out about a new horror is to send an agent in to have an interaction with it (instinct insight attachment or repression) and see what happens. sometimes things go fine and you can use the understanding you earned to unlock sections of the horror's profile. sometimes things go wrong; and when things go wrong in this game it often means that an agent dies.\n\nthe worst however is when things [b][i]appear[/i][/b] to go right but actually you've just triggered something - for instance maybe the agent that just went into that room cannot interact with any other horrors for the rest of the day or they explode (actual example). or maybe the horror will appear to be happy but if you've used an agent with a specific stat level higher than 3 there's a good chance it'll go wild breaking out of its room and sucking the brains out of your employees (actual example). these are the real killers because on later days you're scrolling all over your facility and while you might watch any interaction with a new room closely if it looked like things went okay you probably ordered your agent off on another errand and when they fall over dead for (apparently) no reason you'll have no idea what you triggered to cause their demise.\n\nyes you can eventually unlock the information you need through successful interactions with the horrors; but you might lose multiple agents doing so. losing agents reduces the funds you receive at the end of the level. funds are primarily used to buy new agents so losing agents causes a spiral where you're forced to replace losses with less and/or more poorly-trained agents. the alternative is to replay the day (which the game makes very easy to do granted) using your newly-gained meta-knowledge to avoid whatever costly 'oopsie' that you originally made... or you go to the wiki.\n\nso the problem is that human lives are simultaneously both cheap (in that agents tend to die fairly often) and very expensive (it costs funds to replace agents and it can take days to train their stats back up); and the only way to learn about the new horrors that you're constantly shipping in is to poke at them and see what happens... or look at the wiki; which defeats the point of the 'exploring the unknown' nature of the game.\n\noverall if the theme sounds interesting i'd say it's worth picking up on sale to fool around for <2 hours then make the decision if you want to put in a refund or not.",2022-01-10,2022-01-10,False,66,6,0.690154850482940674,0,False,False,False

positive feedback loop with the most trial-and-error gameplay in the entire medium.[/b]\nstat too low when working on an anomaly? insta-gib. stat too high? insta-gib. your unit got a trait which disallows them from certain work types or working on other anomalies? insta-gib. worked on the same anomaly too often? gib. working on an anomaly deals one of the four possible damage types which the unit has no defenses against? gib. escaped anomaly or boss fight has a surprise aoe attack with one second wind-up that gibs your entire crew unless you manually order your units out of the way? gib. an anomaly that spawns in random area when it escapes and attacks the entire facility every few seconds without any safe spots with damage numbers that instantly make all but the best agents die on first shot? gib-gib-gib. \n\nthere's no way to know any of these rules before you [i]successfully[/i] research and fight an anomaly multiple times. this isn’t like xcom invisible inc. or many other roguelites / permadeath games that do often throw curveballs for players to manage. “manage” being the keyword as in you can figure out a counter through skillful play or ample preparation. lobotomy corp’s most used curveball is an insta-gib with no recovery other than save-scumming. these kind of brutal surprise mechanics in themselves would be fully congruent with the themes of the game and the supposed expendability of your crew – not to mention you get to hear the great alert tracks when things start going bottoms up – but combined with the aforementioned extreme positive feedback loop it means there’s no way you aren’t going to be constantly save-scumming to hell and back.\n\n[b]you know what’s also fun in management sims? functionally horrid ui? shoddy controls? combat that requires precision perfect positioning? how about all of them at once?[/b]\nunits standing in the same spot have their sprites and hp bars cover each other and there's no quick way to find out their current status at a glance – a simple list with filters and “jump camera to unit” command would’ve been enough or having the overlapping units’ hp bars stack on top of each other. there’s no control groups either no order queuing and worst of all units automatically unselect after you give them any order. \n\nthis is especially bad if you send your units to fight enemies with attacks that affect the entire room or when you get one of the events that spawn enemies in all parts of your base and requires you to spread out. it’s a visual clusterchuck that requires precise micro-management. the way you issue move commands is also not ideal since you can only designate rooms and not the exact spot where you want units to stand which is paramount of importance when some late game threats unleash the aforementioned 1-hit kill aoe attacks that require your units to be out of way when it happens.\n\n[b]several bosses and threats end up turning into silly elevator shaft-pause boogaloos.[/b]\nto elaborate some enemies either only spawn in hallways and deal humongous damage or instagib your units if you’re trying to fight them from the front or they have a massive aoe with a second or two of wind-up that hits your *entire base* horizontally at the boss’ current floor and kills all but the highest level and best equipped agents in one shot. the solution? get everyone into an elevator and only fight near them so you can instantly teleport to another floor when the inevitable death wave hits.\n\n[b]few bugs.[/b]\ni had one particularly infuriating one where after several retries and finally achieving two difficult side quests one low tier anomaly's status effect couldn't be removed as it usually should ([spoiler]void dream’s sleep attack which you can remove by clicking on units[/spoiler]) resulting the game considering half my crew dead by the end of the day. to the retry screen it is.\n\n[b]iffy soundtrack placement.[/b]\nlike i mentioned the game has some real bangers and plenty of tracks but most of them are used only for story scenes that last a minute or so or boss fights that get not one but several tracks. however well over 90% of the playtime you’re going to be hearing the one exact same “everything is running smooth” track through actual gameplay assuming you’re doing well. they could’ve spiced it up a bit and have the later days have new tracks play during regular management both to make the soundtrack less repetitive and to signify the increasing complexity you get with juggling lots of dangerous anomalies at once. a real missed opportunity.\n\n[b]the game gets a tad bit grindy especially on subsequent playthroughs.[/b] \nespecially if you’ve already fully researched your current line-up of abnos and just need to generate enough energy for day completion all the while having fully memorized how all your abnos respond to different work types and other hijinks that require micro-management. when lobotomy corporation isn’t an infuriating save-scum fest it’s instead a numbing busywork galore.",2021-08-14,2021-08-14,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

(and just to be clear i refer to x-com in the base/personal/resource management aspect not the tactical combat)\n\n\n\nmy favorite part of ghost stories (or we can call them supernatural horror/thrillers if you prefer) is watching the characters try to figure out the mystery of how things work before they're killed. it's dark and scary but also an intense mystery. \n\nnow suppose someone has a hundred of such stories with all the mystery and investigation and personality and risk. now imagine they've got a vision where some poor manager is put in control of a containment facility where all these creatures are housed and he has to use his brave vulnerable employees to learn as much as possible about these creatures before they destroy everything. \n\nnow take that incredible vision with the countless wonderfully imaginative stories... and cram it into into a buggy tedious poorly translated overpriced phone game. my friends i give you lobotomy corp.\n\n\n\nthe mystery of figuring out the monsters is extremely good. the writing would i think be pretty good if it wasn't deeply scared by a poor translation. the base-management would be challenging but the challenge is destroyed by a super-simplistic metagame (you keep all your info and gear when you reload or restart). the gameplay itself is horrible. \n\n\n\n\n\n(i've rewriten my review after getting to understand the game a bit better although most of the actual info is the same. the original is below if anyone wants my first impressions)\n\nthe things that are good in this game are very very good. and the things that are bad are very very bad. i'm really torn on what to rate this. i almost requested a refund at first but now i find myself enjoying it. i think with some more polish on the playability the game would be truly outstanding. but it didn't happen and i as-is i think it'd be far too frustrating for any of my friends to enjoy.\n\nthis is a game about learning your way around these supernatural monsters. they aren't lovecraftian -- they aren't frighteningly alien they're frighteningly familiar. you progress through positive interactions with them but poor interactions cause problems. meanwhile you're building up a knowledge bank (both in-game and in your head) while trying to manage personal experience and equipment. you can save and load freely and most resources carry over from one playthrough to the next so you are constantly progressing as you play even if you lose repeatedly. \n\nfor the details... since most of the reviews talk about the good i'll start with the bad. \n\ni can't even describe how clunky the controls are. the player doesn't have trouble getting guys to do what he wants but it is so  needlessly complicated. you can't get a list of everyone in the base. you can't get a list of idle characters. if you don't know where a character is in base there's no way to find them. and when assigning characters you can't see all the teams at once so no matter the situation you have to do alot of clicking to get things done. it would be so easy just to have a menu with an overview of characters and monsters that would add so much. it might have been an attempt to simulate the inagility of a large corporation (and there may be upgrades later that i haven't gotten to improve things) but wow it's just difficult. if the base size keeps scaling up the late game is going to be an incredible pain to manage.\n\nnext the english. lots of people complain and there are some quotes that say it's better now. i don't know what it was before but it's difficult now. not game-breaking but challenging. it creates another layer of difficulty that doesn't need to be there. do a search for their manual and skim it you'll get the idea -- in-game information is extremely important and just as confusing. \n\nnow the flip side of the bad english is that it's a game about exploration and figuring out how to survive in a hostile confusing universe. in some ways the broken english almost adds to that element. i still think it'd be better if the devs did a better translation but the broken english isn't all bad. \n\nfor the good... \n\nthe game has a great depth of monsters and they are deliciously diverse. i've played alot of games and i'm not sure i've seen one with this much personality in years maybe decades. the best thing i can compare it to is the variety of races and ships in the old star control 2. complex asymmetric nuanced unique and so full of personality. i'm not sure but i think i'm less than 1/3 of the way into the game and if this game keeps up the pace it may be truly epic. on the other hand if it doesn't it'll become painfully grindy.\n\nthe gameplay when not being limited by the clunky controls is interesting. the monsters are fierce and unforgiving. there are lots of things that can go bad and when they do they can be very very bad. there's some things (including some very routine things) that cause instant game-overs without warning... it would be horrifyingly unfair if there wasn't an easy reload button. instead it feels like you're dealing with the supernatural -- you gotta handle em right. and even with the reload it still is difficult to get through unless you're shamelessly save-scumming. \n\nin terms of replay value... this game is all about knowledge so once you know how to handle a monster their interactions become routine and that happens fairly quickly. there's a finite amount to see and once you've seen it all i can't imagine there's any reason to keep playing. however the game (so far) appears vast and talking about seeing all the monsters in this game might be like finishing all the quests in skyrim or perhaps like having heard all the questions in a version of trivial pursuit. for example i've played through the first 15 days about 3 times now and i think i've seen maybe 25-30 monsters with only 1 or 2 repeats. they seem to come in tiers too so i expect the novelty will continue for the quite a while. \n\nthis game offers you a vast world to explore full of personality and challenge. but the exploration is about the only big thing it offers. it's one big learning curve and outside of seeing new things the game is pretty grindy and difficult to play. with that said i still think i'm enjoying it more than not and i'm curious to see what's deeper in. nonetheless i think the less eclectic people than myself might find this game quite unpleasant. if stumbling through interactions with an unforgiving set of supernatural creatures sounds intriguing then i think you'd also find the game fascinating. just be aware you have to fight through some unpleasant gaming to see it.\n\nbut whether you like it or not i doubt you'll find this game
